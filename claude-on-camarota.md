# Analysis of Steven Camarota's Testimony on the Cost of Illegal Immigration
## Evaluation of Sources, Claims, and Reasoning

### Overview
This analysis examines the January 11, 2024 testimony of Steven Camarota before the House Judiciary Committee, evaluating whether his sources support his claims, whether his reasoning is sound, and whether there are significant methodological issues or omissions.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. **BORDER ENCOUNTER STATISTICS ARE ACCURATELY CITED**
**Status: VERIFIED**

Camarota claims "nearly 8 million 'encounters' at all U.S. borders" from January 2021 to November 2023.

- **Source verification**: CBP official data confirms this is accurate. The House Committee on Homeland Security reports 10.8 million encounters from FY2021-FY2024, with 8.72 million at the Southwest border alone.
- **Assessment**: This claim is solidly supported by primary government sources.

**Sources**: U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforcement statistics; House Committee on Homeland Security factsheets

---

### 2. **NATIONAL ACADEMIES STUDY: ACCURATE CITATION BUT CRITICAL CONTEXT MISSING**
**Status: PARTIALLY VERIFIED WITH MAJOR CAVEATS**

Camarota relies heavily on the 2017 National Academies study, claiming it shows negative fiscal impacts by education level and using Table 8-12 to derive his $68,000 lifetime fiscal drain estimate.

**Problems identified:**

- **The NAS study does NOT separate legal from illegal immigrants**. Camarota acknowledges this but then applies adjustments he created himself to derive illegal-specific estimates. The NAS report explicitly studied all first-generation immigrants together.
  
- **The NAS report's actual conclusion is more nuanced**: The report found that "first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments than are the native-born, but the second generation are among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S."
  
- **Critical omission**: The NAS study used EIGHT different scenarios with varying assumptions, and four showed negative fiscal impacts while four showed positive impacts. Camarota averages all eight scenarios but doesn't explain that the results are highly dependent on assumptions about future government spending, taxation, and how to allocate costs of public goods.
  
- **Camarota's "adjustment" methodology is his own**. He states: "we adjust downward the net fiscal cost of less-educated illegal immigrants on the assumption that they use less in public services than their legal counterparts, but we adjust downward the positive fiscal impact of more educated illegal immigrants based on the assumption that better educated illegal immigrants pay less in taxes." These adjustments are Camarota's assumptions, not findings from the NAS study.

**Assessment**: While Camarota cites the NAS study accurately in some respects, he builds his central $68,000 claim on additional assumptions and adjustments that go well beyond what the NAS study actually concluded. A reader might believe this figure comes directly from the NAS when it substantially reflects Camarota's own modeling.

### 3. **WELFARE USE STATISTICS: METHODOLOGY DEBATE**
**Status: CONTESTED - DEPENDS ON METHODOLOGICAL CHOICE**

Camarota claims 59% of households headed by illegal immigrants use welfare, compared to 39% for U.S.-born households.

**Methodological issue:**

- **Household vs. Individual analysis**: Camarota uses a household-level analysis, meaning if ANY household member receives benefits (including U.S.-born children), the entire household is counted as "using welfare." The Cato Institute, using the same SIPP 2022 data but with an individual-level analysis, finds that noncitizens (including illegal immigrants) consume 54% LESS welfare per capita than native-born Americans.
  
- **Camarota's defense**: He argues household analysis is appropriate because parents benefit when their children receive services. This is a reasonable position but it's a methodological choice, not an objective fact.
  
- **U.S.-born children**: Camarota explicitly notes that "more than half of all illegal immigrant households have at least one U.S.-born child on behalf of whom they can receive benefits." This means the majority of welfare he attributes to "illegal immigrant households" is actually going to U.S. citizens.

**Assessment**: The 59% figure is technically accurate using household-level methodology, but it reflects a methodological choice that produces dramatically different results than individual-level analysis. A more transparent presentation would acknowledge this fundamental methodological disagreement and that the majority of benefits go to U.S. citizen children.

---

### 4. **EDUCATION LEVEL ESTIMATES: SOURCES ARE APPROPRIATE**
**Status: VERIFIED**

Camarota states that 69% of adult illegal immigrants have no education beyond high school (averaging MPI and CMS estimates of 70% and 67%).

**Assessment**: This accurately represents the cited sources. Both MPI and CMS are reputable organizations that specialize in immigration data analysis.

**Sources**: Migration Policy Institute data; Center for Migration Studies data

---

### 5. **GOT-AWAYS ESTIMATE: SECONDARY SOURCES WITH UNCERTAINTY**
**Status: PARTIALLY VERIFIED WITH CAVEATS**

Camarota claims "roughly 1.5 million got-aways since the president took office."

**Issues:**

- **DHS stopped publishing official got-away numbers after 2021**. Camarota relies on Fox News reporting (599,000 in FY2022) and a May 2023 press conference where Secretary Mayorkas seemed to confirm 530,000+ got-aways in FY2023.
  
- **"Seemed to confirm"** is telling language. Camarota is making an inference from a press conference exchange, not citing official published data.
  
- **Inherent uncertainty**: By definition, got-aways are estimated based on sensor data and observations, not direct counts. Camarota himself notes that "former chief of Border Patrol Raul Ortiz said the total number of gotaways could be underreported by as much as 20 percent" in his endnotes.

**Assessment**: The estimate appears reasonable but relies on media reports and inference rather than official published statistics. The uncertainty around got-away estimates should be emphasized more prominently.

**Sources**: Fox News reports; DHS press conference transcript; testimony from former Border Patrol Chief

---

### 6. **PUBLIC EDUCATION COSTS: CALCULATION METHOD IS REASONABLE**
**Status: VERIFIED METHODOLOGY**

Camarota estimates $68.1 billion annual cost for educating 4 million children of illegal immigrants at $17,013 per student (2019-20 average).

**Assessment**: The methodology is straightforward and the per-student cost figure comes from the National Center for Education Statistics, a primary government source. Camarota appropriately notes this is conservative because it doesn't include above-average costs for ESL services or the fact that many illegal immigrants live in high-cost states.

**Important context**: Camarota notes "the vast majority of these children are U.S.-born," meaning they are U.S. citizens being educated in American public schools. Whether their education should be counted as a "cost of illegal immigration" is a framing choice.

**Sources**: National Center for Education Statistics; American Community Survey 2019

---

### 7. **TAX PAYMENT ESTIMATES: REASONABLE BUT WITH ASSUMPTIONS**
**Status: METHODOLOGY IS REASONABLE BUT RELIES ON KEY ASSUMPTION**

Camarota estimates illegal immigrants paid $25.9 billion in federal taxes in 2019 ($5.9B income tax, $16.2B Social Security, $3.8B Medicare).

**Critical assumption**: Camarota assumes 55% of illegal immigrant earnings are subject to taxation ("on the books"). He cites his own 2004 study for this percentage.

**Questions:**

- **Is 55% still accurate in 2019?** The work authorization landscape has changed significantly since 2004 with DACA, expanded TPS, and asylum-related work permits.
  
- **Sensitivity analysis lacking**: Camarota doesn't show how much his estimates would change if this percentage were 45% or 65%.

**Assessment**: The methodology is transparent and reasonable, but the 55% assumption is dated and no sensitivity analysis is provided. The Social Security Administration's own estimate of $13 billion in Social Security taxes paid by illegal immigrants in 2013 suggests Camarota's 2019 estimate of $20 billion in Social Security and Medicare taxes combined is plausible.

**Sources**: Camarota's own 2004 CIS study; Social Security Administration actuarial note

---

### 8. **ILLEGAL POPULATION ESTIMATE: TRANSPARENTLY PRELIMINARY**
**Status: APPROPRIATE CAVEATS PROVIDED**

Camarota estimates the illegal population grew from 10.2 million (January 2021) to 12.8 million (October 2023).

**To his credit**: Camarota explicitly states these estimates are "preliminary" and notes multiple times in endnotes that administrative data is incomplete and methodology involves assumptions about undercount and out-migration.

**Assessment**: While the estimate involves significant assumptions, Camarota is appropriately transparent about uncertainty and limitations. The endnotes show awareness of methodological challenges.

---

### 9. **CITY COST ESTIMATES: ACCURATELY CITED BUT SHORT-TERM**
**Status: VERIFIED**

Camarota cites specific cost estimates for NYC ($12B over 3 years), Chicago ($361M in 2023), DC ($36.4M), Denver ($180M projected), and Massachusetts ($2B over 2 years).

**Assessment**: These figures accurately reflect what those jurisdictions publicly reported. However, these are short-term emergency costs for recent arrivals, not long-term fiscal impact estimates. The distinction matters but Camarota presents them in context.

**Sources**: NYC budget documents; Chicago city council testimony; DC reports; Denver city council; Massachusetts state reports

---

### 10. **UNINSURED HEALTHCARE COSTS: REASONABLE ESTIMATE**
**Status: METHODOLOGY IS SOUND**

Camarota estimates 5.8 million uninsured illegal immigrants account for 22% of the uninsured, creating costs "likely less than $7 billion annually" in public expenditures.

**Assessment**: The calculation is straightforward: MPI estimates 53% uninsured rate among illegal immigrants; total public spending on the uninsured is $33.6 billion; 22% would equal $7.4 billion but Camarota adjusts downward because immigrants are younger and use less healthcare. The methodology is reasonable and the downward adjustment shows appropriate nuance.

**Sources**: Migration Policy Institute; Kaiser Family Foundation

---

### 11. **VISA OVERSTAYS: ACCURATE BUT INCOMPLETE**
**Status: VERIFIED BUT MISSING CONTEXT**

Camarota states DHS showed 850,000 overstays in FY2022 with an overstay rate of 3.67%, "more than double the rate of recent years."

**Missing context**: As Camarota notes in an endnote, "not all of these individuals stay long term, and there is always some number of people who leave the country but whose departure was not properly recorded." The DHS report itself discusses these limitations but Camarota presents the 850,000 figure prominently while relegating this crucial caveat to an endnote.

**Assessment**: Technically accurate but the main text presentation is more alarming than the full DHS report context would suggest.

**Sources**: DHS Entry/Exit Overstay Report FY2022

---

### 12. **GDP IMPACT: APPROPRIATELY CONTEXTUALIZED**
**Status: SOLID REASONING**

Camarota estimates illegal immigrants add $321 billion to GDP but explicitly argues this is "not a measure of their tax contributions or the benefits they create for the U.S.-born."

**Assessment**: This is one of the strongest sections. Camarota correctly explains that GDP growth from immigration primarily benefits the immigrants themselves through wages, and that per capita GDP matters more than aggregate GDP for living standards. This nuanced economic reasoning is appropriate.

---

### 13. **LOGICAL CONSISTENCY: CHILDREN'S COSTS COUNTED TWICE?**
**Status: POTENTIAL DOUBLE-COUNTING ISSUE**

**Problem identified**: Camarota calculates the lifetime fiscal impact of illegal immigrants themselves ($68,000 drain), which "does not include the U.S.-born children" according to his text. But he also separately counts the cost of educating U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants ($68.1 billion) and healthcare for uninsured U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.

**Question**: When presenting total fiscal costs, does Camarota risk double-counting by including both (a) the lifetime fiscal drain of illegal immigrants "excluding their U.S.-born children" and (b) separate line items for costs associated with U.S.-born children?

**Assessment**: The presentation could be clearer about which costs are included where to avoid the appearance of double-counting.

---

### 14. **CRITICAL OMISSION: SECOND GENERATION FISCAL IMPACT**
**Status: MAJOR OMISSION**

The NAS study that Camarota heavily relies on found that "the second generation are among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S. population, contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native-born population."

**Camarota's treatment**: He mentions that U.S.-born children "are not included" in his lifetime fiscal estimates, but never discusses the second generation's positive fiscal contribution that the NAS study emphasized.

**Why this matters**: A complete fiscal analysis of illegal immigration would include:
1. First generation costs (which Camarota estimates)
2. Second generation contributions (which Camarota omits)
3. Intergenerational effects (which the NAS study addressed)

**Assessment**: This is a significant analytical gap. The NAS study's central finding about second-generation immigrants being strong fiscal contributors is highly relevant but not discussed.

---

### 15. **COMPARISON TO NATIVE-BORN: FAIRNESS OF COMPARISON**
**Status: ANALYTICAL ISSUE**

Camarota notes in his conclusion that "legal immigrants and U.S.-born Americans who have relatively few years of school are also a net fiscal drain on average" and states "none of this should be seen as a moral failing."

**Analytical question**: If low-education native-born Americans are also fiscal drains, is it fair to frame this as a problem specific to illegal immigration? Camarota's data suggests this is fundamentally about education level and income, not immigration status per se.

**To his credit**: Camarota does acknowledge this parallel, though briefly.

**Assessment**: The acknowledgment is there but the framing throughout emphasizes illegal immigration rather than the broader structural issue that the welfare system serves low-income workers regardless of origin.

---

### 16. **NET PRESENT VALUE METHODOLOGY: TECHNICAL ISSUE**
**Status: METHODOLOGICAL CONCERN**

Camarota uses Net Present Value (NPV) for lifetime fiscal estimates, which discounts future costs and benefits.

**His own caveat** (in endnote 23): "While commonly used in economics, this approach has the effect of reducing the size of the net fiscal drain that less-educated immigrants create because the costs or benefits in future years are much less relative to more immediate costs. If the NPV concept is not used, the actual net lifetime fiscal drain illegal immigrants create would be much larger than we report here."

**Assessment**: Camarota is transparent about this in an endnote, but the main text presents the $68,000 figure without this important caveat that it's actually a conservative estimate due to discounting methodology.

---

### 17. **FISCAL DETERIORATION CLAIM: VERIFIED**
**Status: VERIFIED**

Camarota claims "the long-term fiscal situation for the country has deteriorated significantly since 2012, the base year the Academies used for its estimate."

**Verification**: Congressional Budget Office reports confirm this. The 2015 CBO projection showed debt held by the public would reach 104% of GDP by 2040; the 2023 projection shows approximately 140% of GDP by the same timeframe.

**Assessment**: This claim is well-supported and relevant to why 2017 NAS estimates might understate current fiscal impacts.

**Sources**: Congressional Budget Office Long-Term Budget Outlooks (2015 and 2023)

---

### 18. **WELFARE ELIGIBILITY PATHWAYS: ACCURATELY EXPLAINED**
**Status: VERIFIED**

Camarota explains that illegal immigrants can access welfare through:
- U.S.-born children (benefits received on their behalf)
- Direct eligibility for WIC and school meals for illegal immigrant children
- State Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants
- Work authorization (DACA, TPS, asylum applicants) allowing EITC

**Assessment**: These pathways are accurately described and properly sourced to federal and state program rules. This is one of the most careful and accurate sections of the testimony.

**Sources**: USDA Food and Nutrition Service; Kaiser Family Foundation state Medicaid data; National Immigration Law Center

---

### 19. **ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVES: MINIMAL ENGAGEMENT**
**Status: SIGNIFICANT OMISSION**

Camarota does not meaningfully engage with alternative analyses or contradictory findings, particularly:

- **The Cato Institute's analysis** of the same SIPP 2022 data reaching opposite conclusions about immigrant welfare use (published in 2023, available when Camarota testified in January 2024)
  
- **The positive long-term scenarios** from the NAS study (4 of 8 scenarios showed positive fiscal impacts)
  
- **Economic benefits beyond GDP** such as entrepreneurship, innovation, labor market complementarity

**Assessment**: For a Congressional testimony meant to inform policy, the lack of engagement with contrary evidence is a weakness. An honest skeptic would want to see these alternatives addressed.

---

### 20. **SOURCE QUALITY: GENERALLY STRONG WITH KEY EXCEPTIONS**
**Status: MIXED**

**Strong sources:**
- National Academies study (peer-reviewed, comprehensive)
- CBP official statistics
- Census Bureau surveys (ACS, CPS, SIPP)
- National Center for Education Statistics
- Congressional Budget Office
- Social Security Administration

**Weaker sources:**
- Fox News for got-away numbers (media report, not official statistic)
- Camarota's own prior publications for key assumptions (e.g., 55% "on the books")
- Secondary testimony and press conferences for some claims

**Self-citation issue**: Camarota frequently cites his own prior CIS publications for methodological choices and assumptions. While not inherently invalid, it means some key assumptions reflect CIS's analytical framework rather than broader academic consensus.

**Assessment**: The core sources are generally authoritative, but some critical datapoints rely on secondary sources or Camarota's own prior work.

---

## Overall Assessment

### Strengths:
1. **Extensive documentation**: Camarota provides 47 endnotes with specific citations
2. **Transparent about limitations**: Repeatedly notes estimates are "preliminary" or involve assumptions
3. **Uses authoritative primary sources** for most major claims
4. **Acknowledges caveats** (though often in endnotes rather than main text)
5. **Sound on some technical points**: GDP discussion, education cost calculation, eligibility pathways

### Weaknesses:
1. **Central $68,000 estimate involves multiple layers of assumptions** beyond what NAS study concluded
2. **Methodological choices favor higher cost estimates** (household vs. individual analysis)
3. **Second-generation positive contributions omitted** despite being in his primary source
4. **Limited engagement with alternative analyses** and contradictory findings
5. **Framing choices throughout** emphasize costs over benefits or structural issues
6. **Some key datapoints rely on** media reports or dated assumptions
7. **Critical caveats relegated to endnotes** while headline figures emphasized in main text

### Bottom Line:
Camarota's testimony is **substantially more sophisticated than simple advocacy** and his sources generally support his specific factual claims. However, his **analytical framework makes numerous choices that systematically favor finding higher costs**: using household rather than individual analysis, applying his own adjustments to the NAS data, omitting second-generation contributions, and framing education of U.S. citizen children as an immigration cost. A reader who relied only on Camarota's testimony would get an incomplete and tilted picture of the fiscal impact of illegal immigration. The testimony is more advocacy based on selective interpretation of legitimate research than neutral presentation of evidence.

An honest skeptic should **accept most of Camarota's specific factual claims as accurate** while recognizing that **the overall narrative is built on methodological choices and framing decisions** that could reasonably be made differently, leading to substantially different conclusions.

**Note**: I attempted to access the full NAS Table 8-12 directly but was unable to fetch the specific chapter page. My analysis of Camarota's use of that table is based on (1) what Camarota himself reports about it in his testimony, (2) the NAS summary materials and press releases, and (3) secondary analyses by other researchers (Cato, Manhattan Institute) who also used the NAS data.
