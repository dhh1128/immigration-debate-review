I previously asked several AIs to evaluate some testimony delivered to US Congress by Camarota in 2024. It concerns the fiscal impacts of illegal immigration. I am attaching the reports that they generated.

Now I'd like to dig into the NAS report that Camarota cites in important ways. I understand that it considers many different frameworks for evaluating the impacts of immigration -- not all of the immigration being illegal, and not all of the frameworks being fiscal. I am attaching another report you wrote, suggesting a number of those frameworks that may have been analyzed in the NAS report. I also understand that the report was based on data collected in 2012? Is that accurate?

I'd like to know how likely the data is to be different since the NAS report was written. We've gone through several presidents and congresses since then, and both Biden and Trump have altered how immigration policies are enforced, in statistically significant ways.

I'd also like to understand how likely it is that Camarota's choice (to average the 8 ways/factors/frames for evaluating immigration's impact) produced true-to-life estimates versus skewed estimates. I understand that the NAS report specifically warned against doing this? 

Did the NAS report focus only on first-generation immigrants, or did it examine the overall impact across multiple generations? Did Camarota follow the NAS report's decision in this respect, or use a different timeframe?

What else should I know about the NAS report that would help me understand its relevance, its limitations, and whether it says important things that Camarota ignores, distorts, or alternatively enhances?
