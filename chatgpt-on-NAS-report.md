Below is what I think you most need to know about the **National Academies (NAS/NASEM) 2017 report, *The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration*** in order to evaluate (a) whether it is “stale” given post-2017 policy changes and (b) whether Camarota’s use of it is methodologically faithful.

---

## 1) Was the NAS fiscal analysis “based on 2012 data”?

**Mostly “early-2010s,” but not cleanly “2012 only.”** The NAS fiscal chapters combine multiple data inputs and time frames:

* The panel uses microdata spanning multiple years (e.g., CPS March) for key distributional/fiscal calculations; in Chapter 8 they explicitly reference CPS March going back to 1994 and extending to 2013. ([National Academies][1])
* They align microdata totals to **National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)** aggregates and point to program outlays and defense totals around **2013** in the description of their accounting alignment. ([National Academies][1])

So: **treat “~2012” as shorthand for “a baseline around the early 2010s,” not a single-year dataset.** Camarota’s “2012 base year” phrasing is directionally consistent with “early-2010s baseline,” but it can mislead readers into thinking the NAS used a single 2012 snapshot as a hard anchor.

---

## 2) How likely are the fiscal results to differ today?

High likelihood that *some* inputs have shifted materially since the report’s baseline—especially if you care about **unauthorized** immigration specifically (which NAS does not isolate) and if you care about **state/local** fiscal pressure.

### The big drivers that can change the results (and why)

1. **Federal fiscal trajectory worsened materially versus the mid-2010s baseline used in many long-horizon fiscal discussions.**
   CBO long-term outlooks have generally moved toward higher debt ratios over comparable horizons (for example, the 2023 and 2025 long-term outlooks show very high debt-to-GDP paths under current law). ([Congressional Budget Office][2])
   **Why it matters:** In NAS-style “average-cost” allocations, a worse fiscal backdrop can mechanically make *any* additional population look more “costly” under some scenarios—not because immigrants changed, but because the government’s long-run financing gap changed.

2. **Composition of flows post-2020 likely differs from the cohorts implicitly represented in early-2010s data.**
   If the marginal entrant mix shifts toward asylum seekers/parolees with faster work authorization, different income profiles, and different near-term service utilization, the “fiscal signature” changes. (NAS’s estimates are very sensitive to earnings/education profiles and benefit/tax interactions.) ([National Academies][1])

3. **State/local benefit design and emergency-response spending changed unevenly.**
   NAS emphasizes that subnational fiscal effects vary greatly by state/local policy and immigrant characteristics. ([National Academies][1])
   Recent years have also seen acute city/state budget episodes tied to migrant inflows (short-run sheltering, schooling, etc.), which are *not* what the NAS long-run cohort model was built to capture.

**Bottom line:** It is reasonable to suspect that **point estimates (like a single “$68k NPV” figure)** are more fragile today than **qualitative structural conclusions** (e.g., what assumptions drive sign flips; how strongly second generation matters; why state/local vs federal differs).

---

## 3) Did NAS warn against “averaging the eight scenarios,” and is Camarota’s averaging likely to skew?

### What NAS is clearly doing with scenarios

NAS treats the multiple scenarios as a **robustness/sensitivity apparatus** across key normative/structural choices (e.g., how to allocate public goods; how to handle interest costs; what governments “adjust” in response to population). ([National Academies][1])
They explicitly describe examining results across an “array” of alternative assumptions and note that choices like excluding interest payments are mainly sensitivity tests and **“not…realistic.”** ([National Academies][1])

### Why an unweighted average is methodologically loaded (even if not “mathematically wrong”)

As your attached analyses note, Camarota’s approach—**unweighted mean of eight scenarios**—implicitly assigns equal probability/credence to each scenario. 
But NAS’s scenario set is not presented as a calibrated probability distribution; it is presented as **“here is how answers change under different defensible accounting conventions and fiscal incidence assumptions.”** ([National Academies][1])

**Skew risk:** averaging can produce a number that is:

* **More “precise-looking” than justified**, because the spread is the point; and
* **Potentially non-representative**, if one thinks some assumptions are clearly closer to policy reality than others (e.g., marginal-cost vs average-cost treatment of public goods; whether/when governments adjust spending/taxes).

A more NAS-faithful summary would usually be: **report the range (or a small set of scenario families), explain what flips the sign, and avoid a single “headline” central tendency unless you defend scenario weights.**

---

## 4) First-generation only, or multi-generation?

**NAS explicitly treats immigration’s fiscal impact as intergenerational.** The report’s own headline framing is that:

* **First generation** tends to be more costly fiscally than natives, **but**
* **Second generation** tends to be among the strongest fiscal contributors. 

And in the fiscal chapter’s setup, they stress the need to consider **immigrants and their descendants**, and that the full fiscal impact must incorporate those downstream generations. ([National Academies][1])

### Did Camarota follow NAS on this point?

Per your attached evaluations, **no—at least not in how the “$68k” figure is framed.** Multiple reviewers highlight that Camarota leans on NAS Table 8-12 to extract a lifetime fiscal number while **omitting (or deemphasizing) NAS’s intergenerational “second generation is strongly positive” core conclusion**, which is central for interpreting *overall* impact rather than *first-generation-only* impact. 

This is not a small nuance: it changes whether the fiscal question is “cost of the immigrant cohort” versus “net fiscal effect of an immigration wave once children’s adult taxes are counted.”

---

## 5) The single most important limitation: NAS does **not** isolate “illegal” vs “legal”

NAS’s fiscal estimates are **not an unauthorized-immigrant study**. Your attached analysis is correct that Camarota acknowledges this and then layers in his own adjustments to map NAS results onto “illegal immigration” specifically. 

That mapping step is where a lot of the action is, because unauthorized status changes:

* earnings trajectories and tax compliance patterns,
* benefit eligibility and take-up,
* return migration,
* state/local program access.

So, when you read Camarota’s “$68k” as an “NAS-based” number, the right mental model is: **NAS provides the scaffold; the illegal-specific inference is largely Camarota’s modeling judgment.** 

---

## 6) Additional “gotchas” in the NAS fiscal framework that matter for your skepticism

1. **“Public goods” allocation is not a technical footnote; it is a first-order driver.**
   If you spread fixed costs (defense, debt service, overhead) on an average-cost basis, adding population “inherits” those costs. If you treat many of those costs as marginally near-zero for an additional person (at least in the short run), the sign can flip. NAS’s scenario approach is largely about making those value judgments explicit. ([National Academies][1])

2. **Short-run local shocks vs. long-run cohort accounting are different questions.**
   NAS is built for long-run, cohort-style fiscal incidence. It is not designed to capture emergency municipal sheltering or sudden school enrollment surges over 6–24 months. If Camarota mixes those rhetorically (long-run NPV + short-run city costs), that can be persuasive but analytically apples-to-oranges.

3. **Discounting (NPV) is normatively meaningful.**
   NPV shrinks later-generation benefits/costs and changes the relative weight of childhood schooling costs versus adult tax contributions. Your reviewers noted Camarota even concedes discounting reduces apparent long-run drains in some cases. 
   For your purposes: whenever you see a single NPV number, you should ask “discount rate? horizon? whose descendants counted?”

---

## 7) A practical way to test whether Camarota’s “average-of-eight” is “true-to-life” or “skewed”

If you want to evaluate this rigorously without guessing political intent, treat it like a model validation exercise:

1. **Cluster the eight NAS scenarios into families** (e.g., public-goods allocation rules; interest-cost treatment; government adjustment assumptions).
2. For each family, ask: “Which family best matches *observed* policy behavior over the last 10–20 years?” (This is contestable, but it’s at least a defensible weighting exercise.)
3. Then compute a **weighted central estimate** (or refuse to) and compare it to an unweighted mean.

This is exactly where an unweighted average becomes hard to defend: it dodges the necessary empirical/policy judgment about which scenario family corresponds to reality.

---

➕—If you want, I can (a) pull the exact language around the NAS scenario methodology and (b) reconstruct a “scenario family” map so you can see which assumptions are doing the work behind Table 8-12 and whether an unweighted mean is defensible under any reasonable weighting scheme.
