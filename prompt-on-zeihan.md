I am analyzing testimony by Camarota, before Congress in 2024, about the negative economic impact that immigration has. He claims that the net present value of the net lifetime cost to the US economy of an immigrant is 68k. In Zeihan's book, "The Accidental Superpower", he has one or more chapters on immigration. I believe he argues that immigration in the US partially mitigates the demographic implosion that is happening in other western, developed countries -- and that he argues that repressive policies toward immigration create ghettos and enclaves where law enforcement is mistrusted, thus allowing drugs and violence to thrive. Are there other notable ideas in this section of his book -- particularly ones that might bear on the arguments of Camarota? Does Zeihan cite any sources to support any of his reasoning? Does he provide any quantification? Please provide a 1000-1500 word summary of Zeihan's ideas about immigration, using language that is simple enough to be easily understood by a high school student, but clear and information-dense. Include inline citations and endnotes for anything that is not Zeihan's own reasoning in the book. Inline citations should be in ACM numbered format, and the endnotes should expand those numbered citations, also in ACM format. Output your response as a markdown code block.
