# ChatGPT's response to my question about Manhattan Institute's bias
The **Manhattan Institute** is best described as **right-of-center / conservative (often “market-oriented” or “free-market conservative”)** in U.S. ideological terms. Multiple third-party bias raters place it on the **Right** or **Lean Right**, and the Institute’s own mission language emphasizes **economic freedom, individual responsibility, and policy approaches typically associated with U.S. conservatism**.

### 1) What the Manhattan Institute says it is (self-description that maps ideologically)

On its official “About” and homepage materials, the Institute emphasizes themes strongly associated (in U.S. politics) with the **center-right/right**: *expanding economic freedom*, *educational choice*, *fiscal responsibility*, and similar framing. ([Manhattan Institute][1])
It also uses the mission language “to develop and disseminate new ideas that foster greater economic choice and individual responsibility” in its own materials. ([Manhattan Institute][2])

Implication for the spectrum: in contemporary U.S. politics, a sustained focus on **economic freedom + limited regulation/greater choice + individual responsibility** typically places an institution **to the right of the median Democratic coalition**, and often aligned with **Republican policy priors** on taxation, regulation, welfare design, and related governance questions.

### 2) How third-party “bias” raters place it (concrete external labels)

Two commonly referenced bias-rating services categorize the Manhattan Institute as right-leaning:

* **Media Bias / Fact Check (MBFC):** rates the Manhattan Institute **“Right Biased”** and rates factual reporting **“Mixed”** (MBFC’s rationale includes concerns such as funding transparency and sourcing issues, and it cites at least one failed fact-check). ([Media Bias/Fact Check][3])
* **AllSides:** rates the Manhattan Institute **“Lean Right”** as a think tank / policy group. ([AllSides][4])

These are not perfect instruments (they’re not academic measures), but they provide **consistent, checkable third-party placement** in the right-of-center band.

### 3) A useful cross-check: City Journal (the Institute’s flagship publication)

Because think tanks publish a lot of “analysis” and advocacy, a helpful proxy is their main outlet. The Manhattan Institute publishes **City Journal**. ([Manhattan Institute][5])

City Journal is also rated as right-leaning by major raters:

* **MBFC:** **“Right Biased”** and **“Mostly Factual.”** ([Media Bias/Fact Check][6])
* **AllSides:** **“Right.”** ([AllSides][7])

This doesn’t “prove” every Manhattan Institute product is equally partisan, but it is consistent with (and reinforces) the Institute’s placement in the **right-of-center** policy ecosystem.

### 4) Bottom line phrasing

A precise, evidence-backed characterization is:

* **“The Manhattan Institute is a conservative, market-oriented think tank that is consistently categorized as Lean Right / Right by major media-bias rating services, and whose own mission language emphasizes economic freedom and individual responsibility—positions that usually map to the U.S. right-of-center policy agenda.”** ([Media Bias/Fact Check][3])

➕—If you tell me the policy domain you care about (e.g., policing/criminal justice, housing, education, climate/energy), I can map Manhattan Institute positions relative to mainstream Democrats and Republicans using specific publications and also flag where critics argue its work is strongest vs. weakest.
