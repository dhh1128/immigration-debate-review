## Process

Years ago, I had read Peter Zeihan's <cite>The Accidental Superpower</cite>. A significant section of that book talks about immigration through a law enforcement and demographic lens. Zeihan is not long on statistics, and the book is now somewhat dated, but some of Zeihan's ideas were still knocking around in my head. Then, a few months ago, I did a quick literature search, looking for hard data on immigration. I wanted to know how much of it was happening, and how it slotted into various categories (H1B vs. asylum vs. illegal, etc.). I found some documents from the Census Bureau and several other federal agencies. However, my high-level impression was that the data was hard to synthesize. It covered different time periods (sometimes in incompatible ways); it started from different assumptions (not all of which were easy for me to track); it used different categories; it produced measures that didn't map to the questions in my head. I was a bit discouraged.

So [here](facebook-post) is a Facebook post I wrote in early December 20205 that asked some smart people I know for suggestions about hard, primary data.

In response to this request, I got several anecdotes from people in service industries (e.g., health care, law, social services). They told stories of immigrants paying their bills, mostly, but struggling and being only partly integrated. I believe what those sources told me, but they don't allow me to paint an aggregate picture with high confidence, because they are not a random sample, they don't cover all aspects of the picture, and they are skewed toward my physical location in the Mountain West, a bit removed from the Mexican border.

One voice on the right pointed me to [testimony from Camarota to Congress in 2024](camarota-testimony.pdf). This is partly a primary and partly a secondary source, and Camarota is known to be pretty partisan. However, his testimony is careful, detailed, and well footnoted, and it references a lot of other useful data sources. I think it is a good embodiment of arguments being made by the Trump administration and its supporters: Camarota asserts that immigrants are draining financial resources from the country.

Camarota's testimony references perhaps the gold standard for information on this topic: a [2017 survey and analysis on the impacts of immigration by the National Academies](https://www.nationalacademies.org/projects/DBASSE-CNSTAT-13-03). This is an important, non-partisan source with intelligent and nuanced analysis.

Since welfare fraud by Somali immigrants has been in the news, I tracked down primary data from Minnesota about the [economic impact of immigrants there](https://www.mnchamber.com/blog/economic-contributions-consumers-human-capital-taxpayers-link-world-economy).

A voice that's more left-leaning pointed me to some [superb primary data from the government of New Zealand](https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2024-05/pc-wp-impacts-of-immigration-on-the-labour-market-and-productivity.pdf). Obviously this has limited bearing on issues in the United States, but it does establish some baseline intuition about what other nations in the OECD (like the US) can expect on certain metrics. It serves as a useful sanity check and also a standard for objective, non-partisan, crisp data.

I also found that the [libertarian, right-leaning](chatgpt-on-cato) Cato Institute published a [2023 update of the 2017 NAS report](https://www.cato.org/white-paper/fiscal-impact-immigration-united-states). This is a meaty source that needs analysis. And since Camarota's testimony, the [right-leaning](chatgpt-on-manhattan-institute) Manhattan Institute has also come out with a [detailed report on the impacts of immigration](https://manhattan.institute/article/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-2025-update). Both of these reports contradict Camarota's perspective.

I [worked with 4 AIs to go deeper](README.md#ai-interactions): ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok. I have access to pro versions of the first 3, so I can give them especially challenging questions and ask them to analyze very large documents. Grok is important because it's Elon Musk's offering in AI, and has different tuning and reasoning constraints; if the other three are liberal-leaning, I figured it would provide a counterbalance. In almost all cases, however, the AIs made similar judgments. I didn't detect a lot of skew in their responses. None of their differences were substantive.

I posed a number of questions to these AIs. I explored Camarota's direct testimony, his primary sources, and the connections between them. I also asked for other notable perspectives that might have fresh ideas. That turned up some interesting arguments I had not considered. (I have not yet gone deep on some of them; that's another side project I may or may not eventually get to.) I also explored the 2017 NAS survey Zeihan and the connections between his arguments and Camarota's. All of my prompts and the AI responses are archived on this site, and are listed on my [summary page](README.md).
