# Analysis of Cato Institute (2023) and Manhattan Institute (2025) Reports on Fiscal Impacts of Immigration

## Evaluation of Sources, Claims, and Reasoning

### Overview
This analysis evaluates two reports on the fiscal impacts of immigration as an honest skeptic—neither endorsing nor dismissing their conclusions outright. I assess logical fallacies, unwarranted assumptions, data quality, and conclusion validity based on the reports' content, methodologies, and external critiques. I also discuss their relevance, limitations, and relation to Steven Camarota's 2024 congressional testimony (which cites the 2017 National Academies of Sciences (NAS) report but not these later works). Camarota's testimony emphasizes negative fiscal drains from low-educated illegal immigrants, averaging a $68,000 lifetime net present value (NPV) cost per person (adjusted from NAS data). These reports update or build on NAS, often reaching more positive conclusions, which Camarota ignores—potentially because they challenge his narrative.

The Cato report (March 2023, by Alex Nowrasteh and Michael Howard) existed before Camarota's January 2024 testimony but is not cited. The Manhattan Institute (MI) report (October 2025, by Daniel Di Martino) post-dates it. Both use similar data (e.g., Current Population Survey (CPS) and Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections) but differ in assumptions, horizons, and framing.

## Key Findings for Cato Institute Report (2023): "The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States"

### 1. **MAIN CONCLUSIONS: GENERALLY POSITIVE FISCAL IMPACTS**
**Status: PLAUSIBLE BUT SENSITIVE TO ASSUMPTIONS**

Cato concludes immigrants have a more positive net fiscal impact than native-born Americans overall (+$76,000 average NPV per immigrant vs. more negative for natives), federally positive, and state/local mixed (less positive or negative). Low-educated immigrants (e.g., high school dropouts arriving at 25) are +$216,000 NPV (excluding descendants) or +$57,000 (including), vs. -$32,000/-$177,000 for natives.

- **Assessment**: Supported by their models, but relies on optimistic assumptions (e.g., marginal public goods cost = zero for one immigrant, boosting positivity). External critiques (e.g., MI's 2024 report, addressed in MI's 2025 update) note Cato overvalues tax credits by growing them with productivity (MI fixes by separating credits from liability and growing credits by inflation only). No major logical fallacies, but the "more positive than natives" framing could mislead if readers overlook that both groups contribute to deficits in absolute terms—immigrants just less so.

### 2. **METHODOLOGY: UPDATES NAS WITH "CATO MODEL" IMPROVEMENTS**
**Status: TRANSPARENT BUT WITH UNWARRANTED ASSUMPTIONS**

Cato replicates NAS 2017 with 1994–2018 CPS data, then creates an "Updated Model" (30-year horizon vs. NAS's 75-year due to CBO changes) and "Cato Model" (adds capital income taxes per Clemens 2021, reallocates U.S.-born dependents to second generation, predicts young immigrants' education via regressions).

- **Data Quality**: High—CPS (4.6M observations), ACS, CBO projections, National Health Expenditure Accounts. Historical analysis (1994–2018) uses cross-sectional data; projections incorporate demographics (fertility, mortality, emigration).
- **Logical Issues**: Reallocating dependents to second generation is defensible (aligns with beneficiary focus) but assumes U.S.-born children of immigrants are fiscally identical to other natives, potentially underestimating costs if intergenerational poverty persists (unwarranted without sensitivity tests). Capital income addition doubles immigrant taxes—a major upward adjustment based on one study (Clemens 2021); critics (e.g., MI) argue it's ad hoc and age/education-specific data is lacking.
- **Assumptions**: 3% discount rate (standard); 1.1% productivity growth (updated from NAS's 1%); remittances at 20% income (fixed, no variation). Limitations acknowledged: 30-year horizon underestimates long-term positives for young immigrants; no separate illegal immigrant analysis due to small CPS samples.

**Assessment**: Methodology improves on NAS (e.g., fixes tax biases), but "Cato Model" choices systematically favor positives (e.g., capital adjustment lacks robustness checks). Data is reputable, but small samples for subgroups (e.g., illegals) limit granularity.

### 3. **FISCAL IMPACTS BY EDUCATION LEVEL: POSITIVE FOR IMMIGRANTS ACROSS BOARD**
**Status: SUPPORTED BUT OVERSTATED FOR LOW-EDUCATED**

Higher education yields more positives (college+ pay 4x+ taxes of dropouts). Even dropouts are positive for immigrants (+$216,000 NPV at age 25, excluding descendants) due to working-age focus and lower benefits.

- **Assessment**: Data shows education gradient, but positives for low-educated rely on marginal cost scenarios (average costs make them less positive). No fallacy, but assumes no labor market displacement—potentially unwarranted given debates on low-wage competition.

### 4. **GENERATIONAL EFFECTS: FIRST GEN MOST POSITIVE, DESCENDANTS REDUCE BUT DON'T ELIMINATE GAINS**
**Status: REASONABLE WITH CAVEATS**

First generation: Positive due to youth and barriers to benefits. Second: Often most positive via education gains. Third-plus: More negative (aging, entitlements). Including descendants reduces immigrant NPVs but keeps them positive.

- **Assessment**: Reallocation of dependents improves first-gen scores but assumes second-gen education fully converges (via regressions)—optimistic if cultural/economic barriers persist. Limitations: Short horizon excludes full retirement costs.

### 5. **CRITIQUES OF PREVIOUS STUDIES: FAIR ON NAS, INDIRECT ON CAMAROTA**
**Status: VALID BUT SELECTIVE**

Critiques NAS for tax biases, dependent allocation, and outdated growth (1% vs. 1.1%). Implies Camarota/CIS claims of negatives are unsupported, as results show positives.

- **Assessment**: Critiques are evidence-based (e.g., cites Clemens), but ignores NAS's sensitivity to scenarios (4/8 positive in NAS; Cato focuses on favorable ones). No ad hominem, but selective—doesn't engage CIS's household-level welfare analysis.

### Overall Assessment for Cato Report
**Strengths**: Transparent methodology, reputable data, addresses NAS flaws, shows sensitivities (8 scenarios). Conclusions are substantiated but more positive than NAS due to updates (newer data shows improved immigrant education/earnings).
**Weaknesses**: Assumptions bias upward (capital addition, dependent reallocation); short horizon limits long-term view; no illegal-specific analysis despite relevance. Logical fallacy: Potential cherry-picking of optimistic scenarios (marginal costs). Data quality high, but ad hoc fixes (e.g., CPS censoring multiplier=2) warrant caution.
**Relevance/Limitations**: Updates NAS to 2018 data/CBO changes, showing immigration more positive over time (e.g., education gap narrowed). Limitations: Excludes post-30-year effects; assumes constant emigration (tests show higher rates disadvantage immigrants). 
**Relation to Camarota**: Cato directly counters Camarota's $68,000 drain (from NAS adjustments for illegals/low-educated)—shows +$57,000 for similar dropouts including descendants. Camarota ignores this (despite availability), potentially distorting by not engaging contrary evidence. Cato improves on Camarota by using individual-level analysis (vs. his household-level, inflating welfare use) and including generational positives he omits.

## Key Findings for Manhattan Institute Report (2025): "The Fiscal Impact of Immigration (2025 Update)"

### 1. **MAIN CONCLUSIONS: MIXED IMPACTS, POSITIVE FOR HIGH-SKILLED**
**Status: BALANCED BUT POLICY-DRIVEN**

MI concludes immigrants reduce federal deficits overall (+$350,000/30 years for legal average) but expand debt for unlawful/low-educated (-$80,000 average). High-skilled (advanced degrees) yield +$3.1M/30 years; dropouts -130K. Reforms (high-skilled shift) save $20T in debt/30 years.

- **Assessment**: Supported, but framing as "better immigrants needed" (policy advocacy) risks confirmation bias—assumes current mix is suboptimal without comparing to non-immigration baselines. No major fallacies, but nominal dollars (no discounting) inflate long-term figures.

### 2. **METHODOLOGY: CBO-ALIGNED WITH DESCENDANTS/ECONOMIC EFFECTS**
**Status: ROBUST BUT WITH ARBITRARY CHOICES**

Uses 10/30-year nominal horizons (CBO-style); categorizes immigrants by age/education; includes descendants (fertility 1.8-1.6), emigration (declining function), public goods (excludes defense), debt interest (cumulative), GDP growth (42.6% of labor income + capital effects).

- **Data Quality**: High—CPS/ACS 2023-24, CBO 2024-2054, DHS visa data. Models 35 immigrant groups; education transitions from NAS matrix.
- **Logical Issues**: Assumes no labor substitution/complementation (unwarranted simplification; literature shows complements for high-skilled). Emigration function fits data but assumes uniform rates (no education variation). Institutionalization (1% average) is assumption-heavy (e.g., low-educated higher prison rates).
- **Assumptions**: Half female for fertility; GDP labor share 57% (standard); 10-year public goods catch-up. Limitations: Short window underestimates young immigrants' positives; nominal focus ignores time value.

**Assessment**: Improves on prior MI (fixes debt interest, tax credits per Cato critique). Data strong, but assumptions (e.g., descendants like natives) could underestimate upward mobility.

### 3. **FISCAL IMPACTS BY EDUCATION LEVEL: NEGATIVE FOR LOW, POSITIVE FOR HIGH**
**Status: WELL-SUPPORTED**

College+ positive (bachelor's +$1.6M/30 years); dropouts negative (-$130K). Driven by taxes (3.3x higher for educated) and benefits (2.3x higher for low-skilled).

- **Assessment**: Clear gradient, but includes descendants amplifying low-educated burdens—defensible but sensitive to fertility assumptions (low-educated have 60% more children).

### 4. **GENERATIONAL EFFECTS: DESCENDANTS AMPLIFY BURDENS FOR LOW-EDUCATED**
**Status: APPROPRIATE BUT LIMITED BY HORIZON**

Second/third generations: More educated but net burdens until working age. Low-educated immigrants add more population long-term via fertility.

- **Assessment**: Includes more generations than Cato's short horizon, but 30-year cutoff excludes full contributions. Assumption of mean reversion in education is evidence-based (NAS) but optimistic for high-educated (90% college descendants).

### 5. **CRITIQUES OF PREVIOUS STUDIES: CONSTRUCTIVE ON NAS/CATO**
**Status: FAIR AND RESPONSIVE**

Critiques NAS for average life expectancy (fixes with education-specific), dependent allocation, debt interest. Addresses Cato's critique of prior MI by separating tax credits.

- **Assessment**: Evidence-based improvements; no selective ignoring—directly engages Cato's expansion plan, critiquing it for assimilation risks despite gains.

### Overall Assessment for MI Report
**Strengths**: Policy-focused (e.g., visa reforms), includes economic/GDP effects, responds to critiques. Conclusions balanced—acknowledges positives while highlighting composition's role.
**Weaknesses**: Advocacy tone (e.g., "better immigrants"); assumptions simplify complexities (no displacement); short/nominal horizon overestimates short-term burdens. Logical fallacy: Potential strawman of alternatives (e.g., critiques Cato for "eroding social fabric" without data). Data quality high, but small samples for subgroups.
**Relevance/Limitations**: Builds on NAS/Cato with recent data (2023-24), emphasizing legal status/visas (absent in Cato). Limitations: Underestimates long-term (e.g., post-30-year entitlements ignored); assumes constant policies.
**Relation to Camarota**: MI aligns somewhat with Camarota's education focus (negatives for low-skilled) but shows averages positive—challenging his overall drain narrative. Camarota could have improved by incorporating MI-like visa breakdowns (post-dates him) or Cato's updates (ignores). MI says important things Camarota distorts (e.g., positives for legals/high-skilled) or omits (economic growth, reforms).

## Broader Insights on Both Reports
- **Relevance**: Both update NAS with post-2017 data/trends (e.g., rising immigrant education), showing immigration more positive than Camarota's NAS-derived estimates. They highlight policy levers (e.g., high-skilled shifts) Camarota ignores, focusing instead on restrictions.
- **Limitations**: Short horizons undervalue young immigrants; both assume no major policy changes (e.g., welfare reforms). Cato more academic; MI more prescriptive.
- **What Else to Know**: External critiques (e.g., Cato's Bier on MI: Underestimates positives for all groups; MI on Cato: Overvalues credits) show debates center on assumptions (e.g., costs allocation). Read alongside NAS for baseline; consider biases—Cato pro-immigration, MI conservative reformist. Camarota ignores Cato's positives for low-educated/second-gen, distorting by not engaging; neither report fully "improves" him but provides counterbalance.
