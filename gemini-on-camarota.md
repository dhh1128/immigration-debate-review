Based on a review of Steven Camarota's testimony, combined with verification against the primary sources he cites (Census Bureau, National Academies, CBP) and external data (Pew Research, ITEP), here is an evaluation of the truth claims.

### **Report: Analysis of Testimony on the Fiscal Impact of Illegal Immigration**

**Summary of Approach:** The testimony builds a logical argument that illegal immigration is a net fiscal drain. However, the magnitude of this drain depends almost entirely on three specific methodological choices: 1) attributing the costs of U.S.-born citizen children to the illegal immigrant parent; 2) using "household" rather than "individual" welfare metrics; and 3) relying on in-house (CIS) adjustments to external data rather than raw primary findings.

#### **I. Source Quality & Reliance on Internal Analysis**

1. **High Reliance on Self-Citation:** While Camarota cites prestigious primary data sources like the Census Bureau’s CPS (Current Population Survey) and ACS (American Community Survey), the *interpretations* and *specific cost calculations* are largely drawn from his own previous non-peer-reviewed reports. A significant portion of the footnotes cite the "Center for Immigration Studies" (CIS) rather than independent auditors. The specific "$68,000 lifetime cost" figure is not a direct finding from the National Academies (NAS) but a CIS adjustment of NAS data.

#### **II. The "Net Fiscal Drain" Claim (The $68,000 Figure)**

2. **Transformation of NAS Data:** Camarota accurately states that the 2017 National Academies (NAS) study found a negative fiscal impact for immigrants with low education levels. However, the NAS study did *not* provide a specific estimate for illegal immigrants due to data limitations. Camarota derives his figure by applying the NAS "low-education" profile to the illegal population and then adjusting for their legal status. This is a constructed estimate, not a direct citation.
3. **Methodological "Black Box":** Camarota claims to adjust the NAS figures "downward" to account for illegal immigrants' ineligibility for some programs. While this attempts fairness, the exact weighting is an internal CIS calculation. If his assumption about tax compliance (which he sets at 55%) is too low, the calculated "drain" is significantly overstated.

#### **III. Welfare Use Statistics**

4. **The "Household" vs. "Individual" Metric:** Camarota claims 59% of illegal immigrant *households* use welfare. This is statistically accurate based on SIPP data, but misleading without context. He admits that in many of these cases, the recipient is a **U.S.-born citizen child**, not the illegal immigrant themselves. Comparison with external research (e.g., Cato Institute, Bipartisan Policy Center) shows that when measured by *individual* usage, illegal immigrants generally use fewer benefits than native-born Americans due to eligibility bars. Camarota’s choice of the "household" unit maximizes the appearance of welfare dependency.
5. **Attribution of Citizen Costs:** A core philosophical assumption in the testimony is that the cost of U.S. citizens (children born to illegal immigrants) should be counted as a "cost of illegal immigration". While logically sequential (the child wouldn't be here without the parent), legally and fiscally, these costs belong to U.S. citizens. Removing U.S.-born children from the ledger would drastically reduce the cited costs for education and Medicaid.

#### **IV. Education & Demographics**

6. **Accurate Education Statistics:** Camarota claims 69% of adult illegal immigrants have no education beyond high school. This aligns with external data. Pew Research Center estimates that ~74% of unauthorized immigrants have a high school diploma or less. Camarota’s demographic characterization of the population as "low-skill" is factually robust and supported by the consensus of data.
7. **School Cost Assumptions:** The claim that illegal immigration costs public schools $68.1 billion is a mathematical product of the number of children (mostly U.S.-born) multiplied by the average per-pupil spending ($17,013). This is a sound calculation *if* one accepts the premise that U.S. citizen children of immigrants are a "cost of immigration." However, he notes this estimate is "conservative" because it excludes costs for remedial language (ESL) services, a reasonable caveat given that ESL programs are indeed more expensive than standard instruction.

#### **V. Tax Contributions**

8. **Potential Underestimation of Taxes:** Camarota estimates illegal immigrants paid **$25.9 billion** in federal taxes in 2019. This relies on his assumption that only **55%** of illegal immigrants pay taxes "on the books".
9. **Contradictory External Data:** More recent estimates from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP, 2024) suggest the tax contribution is much higher—approximately **$59.4 billion** to the federal government alone (based on 2022 data). Even accounting for inflation and population growth between 2019 and 2022, the discrepancy suggests Camarota’s 55% compliance assumption may be too conservative, thereby inflating the "net drain" calculation.
10. **Net Benefit to Entitlements:** Camarota honestly acknowledges that illegal immigrants are a "clear net benefit" to Social Security and Medicare because they pay in (via payroll taxes) but are barred from receiving benefits. He uses this to argue *against* legalization, reasoning that legalizing them would turn this net positive into a net negative as they became eligible to collect.

#### **VI. Border Numbers & Crime**

11. **Verification of "Got-Aways":** Camarota’s citation of ~1.5 million "got-aways" since 2021 is consistent with data released by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and House Committee reports. His description of the "unprecedented" surge in encounters aligns with official DHS statistics.
12. **Visa Overstays:** He correctly identifies that a large portion of the illegal population stems from visa overstays, not just border crossers, and cites DHS reports showing a 3.67% overstay rate. This adds nuance often missing from purely border-focused arguments.

#### **VII. Economic Reasoning**

13. **The "Static" vs. "Dynamic" Trap:** Camarota dismisses the $321 billion illegal immigrants add to GDP as irrelevant to fiscal impact, arguing that the gains go mostly to the immigrants themselves. This ignores the standard economic view (supported by the NAS report he cites elsewhere) that immigrants lower consumer prices and increase the productivity of complementary native workers. By focusing strictly on the *fiscal* ledger (taxes vs. spending) and ignoring *economic* ripples (lower costs for goods/services), the testimony presents a "static" accounting that minimizes potential economic benefits.

#### **VIII. Conclusion on Truthfulness**

* **Solid on Demographics/Border Stats:** Camarota’s figures on population size, education levels, and border encounters are well-grounded in primary government data.
* **Dependent on Methodology for Costs:** The "Fiscal Drain" conclusion is not a raw fact but a result of specific methodological choices—chiefly the decision to count U.S. citizen children as costs and the use of lower-end estimates for tax compliance.
* **Transparent but Self-Referential:** He is generally transparent about his adjustments (e.g., admitting he adjusted the NAS data), but the validity of those adjustments rests on the credibility of CIS's internal models rather than external peer review.

---

Here are the specific primary and secondary sources I consulted to analyze the truth claims in Steven Camarota's testimony.

I have categorized them by the specific claims they were used to verify or critique.

### **I. To Verify Tax Contribution Estimates**

* **Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP)**
* *Report:* "Tax Payments by Undocumented Immigrants"
* *Date:* July 30, 2024
* *Key Finding:* This study estimates that undocumented immigrants paid **$96.7 billion** in total taxes in 2022, with **$59.4 billion** going to the federal government.
* *Relevance:* This contrasts sharply with Camarota’s estimate of **$25.9 billion** (2019 data), suggesting his figures may be outdated or rely on overly conservative compliance assumptions (he assumes only 55% compliance; ITEP data suggests higher engagement, particularly via payroll taxes).



### **II. To Verify "Fiscal Drain" & Education Claims**

* **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS)**
* *Report:* "The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration"
* *Date:* 2017
* *Key Finding:* This is the "gold standard" consensus report Camarota cites. It confirms that immigrants with low education levels generally have a negative net fiscal impact at the state/local level but often a positive impact at the federal level over a 75-year horizon.
* *Relevance:* It validates Camarota's baseline logic but highlights that his specific numbers for *illegal* immigrants are his own derivations (adjustments) rather than direct outputs from the NAS study.


* **Pew Research Center**
* *Report:* "Record 14 Million Unauthorized Immigrants Lived in the US in 2023"
* *Date:* August 21, 2025 (latest data update)
* *Key Finding:* Confirms that the unauthorized population has grown to record levels (14 million) and that a significant portion has education levels at or below a high school diploma (roughly 24% of *all* immigrants have not completed high school, compared to 7% of U.S.-born).
* *Relevance:* Supports Camarota’s demographic characterization of the population as generally lower-skill/lower-education than the native-born workforce.



### **III. To Verify Welfare Use (Household vs. Individual)**

* **Cato Institute**
* *Report:* "Immigrant and Native Consumption of Means-Tested Welfare and Entitlement Benefits in 2022"
* *Date:* February 18, 2025
* *Key Finding:* When measuring by **individual** usage, immigrants consume 21% *less* welfare per capita than native-born Americans. Non-citizen immigrants specifically consume 54% less.
* *Relevance:* This provides the counter-evidence to Camarota’s "household" methodology. It shows that his high welfare numbers (59%) are largely driven by counting U.S. citizen children and using the "household" unit rather than the "individual" unit.



### **IV. To Verify Border Encounters & "Got-Aways"**

* **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)**
* *Data:* "Southwest Land Border Encounters" and "CBP Enforcement Statistics Fiscal Year 2023"
* *Date:* October 2023 / Ongoing
* *Key Finding:* Confirms record encounter rates (over 2.4 million in FY23) and high numbers of "got-aways" (roughly 1.7 million observed since FY21).
* *Relevance:* Confirms that Camarota’s statistics regarding the scale of the border crisis and the volume of new entries are factually accurate and based on official government data.
