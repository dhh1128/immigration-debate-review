# Analysis of the 2017 NAS Report and Camarota's Use of It

## Executive Summary

The 2017 National Academies of Sciences (NAS) report "The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration" is a complex, multi-faceted study that **explicitly warns against simple averaging** of its various scenarios. Camarota's methodology of averaging the 8 scenarios appears to violate the report's core methodological guidance. The report's data runs from 1994-2013, making it increasingly outdated. Most critically, the report examined **all generations of immigrants** (first, second, and third-plus generations) over 75-year lifespans, while Camarota focused narrowly on **first-generation illegal immigrants only** in short-term snapshots.

## 1. Data Timeline and Currency

### What the NAS Report Used

**Historical Analysis Period: 1994-2013**
- The report used Current Population Survey (CPS) data from these years
- This was the most recent data available when the report was published in 2017
- The cross-sectional "snapshots" analyzed fiscal impacts at specific points during this 20-year window

**Forward-Looking Projections: 2013-2088**
- The report also included 75-year projections from 2013 forward
- These used Congressional Budget Office (CBO) budget projections
- Population projections came from Census Bureau 2017 estimates

### How Outdated Is This Now?

**Significantly outdated for multiple reasons:**

1. **Policy Changes Since 2013:**
   - The Affordable Care Act (ACA) rolled out in 2014 (not included in historical data)
   - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly altered tax rates
   - Multiple administrations with very different immigration enforcement approaches
   
2. **Demographic Shifts:**
   - The unauthorized population has changed substantially since 2013
   - Pew Research now estimates 14 million unauthorized immigrants (2023) vs. ~11 million in the NAS data period
   - Source country composition has shifted (fewer Mexican immigrants, more from other regions)
   
3. **Economic Context:**
   - The Great Recession recovery was still ongoing during the data period
   - Post-pandemic labor markets are fundamentally different
   - Wage patterns, employment rates, and program utilization have all shifted

4. **Immigration Enforcement:**
   - Trump administration (2017-2021): Enhanced enforcement, travel bans, asylum restrictions, public charge rule
   - Biden administration (2021-present): Changed enforcement priorities, ended certain Trump policies, border surge in 2021-2023
   - These changes dramatically affected who enters, who stays, and fiscal impacts

**Bottom line:** Using 2013 data to make claims about 2024 immigration is like using 2002 data to analyze 2013 immigration—you'd miss the Great Recession, the ACA, major tax changes, and fundamental shifts in immigration patterns.

## 2. The Eight Scenarios and the Averaging Problem

### What the Eight Scenarios Were

The NAS report created 8 different scenarios to test **sensitivity to key assumptions**. They were **NOT** meant to be averaged, but rather to show **how much results depend on methodological choices**.

**The Two Main Frameworks:**

**Scenarios 1-4: "Average Cost" Method**
- Assigns immigrants their per-capita share of public goods (defense, interest payments, etc.)
- This is the **conservative** (less favorable to immigration) approach
- Assumes adding one immigrant requires 1/330-millionth more defense spending

**Scenarios 5-8: "Marginal Cost" Method**  
- Assigns immigrants zero cost for pure public goods
- Based on economic theory that defense spending doesn't increase when one person immigrates
- This is the **less conservative** (more favorable to immigration) approach

**The Four Sub-Variations (applied to both frameworks):**

1. **Baseline** - Standard assumptions
2. **Exclude interest payments** - Don't assign debt service to new immigrants (they didn't create past deficits)
3. **Reduced remittances/taxes** - Assumes immigrants send money abroad, reducing their sales tax contributions by 20%
4. **No capital income tax initially** - Assumes recent immigrants (< 10 years) don't own stocks/pay capital gains taxes

### The Critical Range of Results

The report found that scenario choice **massively affected results**:

- **Under average-cost scenarios (1-4):** First-generation immigrants generally had negative fiscal impacts in cross-sectional analysis
- **Under marginal-cost scenarios (5-8):** First-generation immigrants often had **more positive** fiscal impacts than native-born groups

From the report: "For scenarios in which military spending is assumed not to increase with additional immigrants, and in which a cost of zero is assigned to them for this benefit, the net fiscal impact of individuals in the first-generation group becomes **more positive than that of individuals in the two native-born groups**."

### Why the NAS Report Warned Against Averaging

The report **explicitly stated** that these scenarios serve different analytical purposes:

1. **They answer different questions:**
   - Average-cost scenarios: "What if we allocated all government costs proportionally?"
   - Marginal-cost scenarios: "What is the actual incremental cost of one more immigrant?"

2. **The choice depends on the policy question:**
   - For evaluating one additional immigrant: Marginal-cost is more appropriate
   - For evaluating a large wave of immigration: Average-cost might be more appropriate
   - For assessing current population: Mixed approach might be needed

3. **The report emphasized assumptions "can affect results dramatically"**

**The averaging problem:** Averaging across scenarios that assume fundamentally different cost structures is methodologically incoherent. It's like averaging "What if gravity were half as strong?" with "What if gravity were twice as strong?" to get "the truth about gravity."

### Did Camarota Average the Scenarios?

Based on your uploaded reviews, **yes**—Camarota appears to have taken the NAS's low-education immigrant fiscal impacts and averaged or selected from across scenarios without adequately explaining which specific scenario(s) he used or why. The Gemini review notes: "Camarota derives his figure by applying the NAS 'low-education' profile to the illegal population and then adjusting for their legal status. This is a constructed estimate, not a direct citation."

This is problematic because:
- The NAS explicitly warned against treating scenarios as interchangeable
- Different scenarios could yield opposite conclusions
- Camarota's "$68,000 lifetime cost" figure doesn't appear in the NAS report directly

## 3. Generational Scope: First Generation vs. Multi-Generational Analysis

### What the NAS Report Actually Examined

The NAS report was **fundamentally multi-generational** in both conception and analysis:

**Three Generational Groups:**

1. **First Generation:** Foreign-born individuals
2. **Second Generation:** U.S.-born children of immigrants (at least one foreign-born parent)
3. **Third-Plus Generation:** Everyone else (U.S.-born with U.S.-born parents)

**Two Different Analytical Approaches:**

**A. Cross-Sectional Analysis (1994-2013):**
- Looked at fiscal impacts **in specific years**
- Tracked all three generations separately
- Assigned dependent children's costs to their parents' generation
- Result: First-generation adults plus their children showed negative fiscal impact in most scenarios

**B. Longitudinal/Lifecycle Analysis (75-year projections):**
- Followed an immigrant and **all descendants** over 75 years
- Included children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren
- Discounted future taxes and benefits to present value
- Result: **Highly positive overall** for most education levels when including second and third generation contributions

### The Critical Multi-Generational Finding

From the NAS report summary: "**First-generation immigrants are more costly to governments than are the native-born, but the second generation are among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S.**"

The 75-year projections showed:

| Education Level | Net Present Value (75 years, Scenario 1) |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Less than high school | Negative in short term, **positive over 75 years including descendants** |
| High school | Positive |
| More than high school | Strongly positive |

The report emphasized that **focusing only on first-generation immigrants misses the full picture** because:
1. Their U.S.-born children are citizens who become strong taxpayers
2. Educational attainment rises dramatically from first to second generation
3. Second generation have higher earnings than third-plus generation on average

### What Camarota Did Differently

Based on your reviews, Camarota:

1. **Focused on first-generation illegal immigrants only**
   - Did not systematically account for second-generation contributions
   - Treated U.S.-born children as "costs" but didn't project their future tax contributions

2. **Used short-term fiscal snapshots**
   - Did not use 75-year lifecycle projections
   - Focused on cross-sectional "what does it cost this year?" analysis

3. **Assigned children's costs to immigrants**
   - This is actually **consistent** with one NAS approach (the household-based allocation)
   - But he didn't balance it with the NAS finding that these same children become net contributors as adults

**The key distortion:** The NAS report's cross-sectional analysis (which Camarota mirrors) was **explicitly** presented as incomplete without the longitudinal analysis. The report states: "Cross-sectional 'snapshots in time' are instructive, they do neglect the evolution of fiscal costs and benefits over time that occurs as these groups age—an evolution that we know to be important."

## 4. Additional Critical Issues in the NAS Report

### A. The "Household" vs. "Individual" Allocation Problem

The NAS report wrestled with **how to assign children's costs**:

**Individual-based:** Assign education costs to the child
- Shows first-generation adults as more positive (they're working and paying taxes)
- Shows second-generation children as negative (they're consuming education)
- More accurate for lifecycle projections

**Household-based:** Assign children's costs to parents
- Shows first-generation adults as more negative (because of their children)
- More intuitive for "what does an immigrant family cost?"
- What Camarota uses

The NAS used **both approaches** in different parts of the analysis. Camarota uses only the household approach, which maximizes apparent costs.

### B. The "Legal Status" Problem

**The NAS report's major limitation:** It **did not specifically isolate unauthorized immigrants** due to data constraints.

From the report: "The NAS study found a negative fiscal impact for immigrants with low education levels. **However, the NAS study did not provide a specific estimate for illegal immigrants due to data limitations.**"

Instead, it:
- Analyzed education-level cohorts (which include both legal and illegal immigrants)
- Noted that unauthorized immigrants are ineligible for many programs
- Suggested unauthorized immigrants might have **more positive** fiscal impacts than authorized immigrants of similar age "because of their age structure"

**What Camarota did:** He took the NAS "low education" profile and **applied it to unauthorized immigrants**, then "adjusted downward" for program ineligibility. This is a **derived estimate**, not an NAS finding.

### C. The Age Structure Dependency

A huge finding in the NAS report: **Results are "heavily influenced by the age distribution of the underlying groups at the time of data collection."**

During 1994-2013:
- First generation was concentrated at working ages (25-50)
- Second generation was bimodal (young children and elderly)
- Third-plus generation was aging (Baby Boomers approaching retirement)

This meant:
- First generation looked relatively good on taxes, bad on kids' education costs
- Second generation looked bad (elderly on Social Security + young kids in school)
- Third-plus generation started looking worse over time (aging population)

**The projection problem:** These age structures are **completely different now** in 2024 than they were in 2013. Using 2013 data to project 2024 impacts ignores that:
- The first-generation immigrants of 2013 are 11 years older
- Their children (second generation) are now working adults, not school children
- The third-plus generation Baby Boomers are now mostly retired

### D. The Public Goods Allocation Is THE Biggest Driver

The NAS report found that **how you allocate defense spending matters more than almost any other assumption.**

Example from parallel UK study (cited in NAS report):
- Average-cost scenario: **-£76 billion** (immigrants are a fiscal cost)
- Marginal-cost scenario: **+£27 billion** (immigrants are a fiscal benefit)
- That's a £103 billion swing ($130 billion USD)—just from one methodological choice!

The U.S. federal budget has massive public goods spending:
- Defense: ~$800 billion/year
- Interest on debt: ~$600 billion/year
- Other public goods: ~$200 billion/year
- Total: ~$1.6 trillion/year in "public goods"

With 320 million people, that's ~$5,000 per person in public goods annually.

**If you assume immigrants DON'T add to public goods costs** (marginal-cost scenarios 5-8), every immigrant automatically looks $5,000/year better fiscally than if you assume they DO (average-cost scenarios 1-4).

## 5. What the NAS Report Says That Camarota Ignores

### A. Second Generation Are Fiscal Stars

**Direct quote from NAS:** "Second generation adults had on average a **more favorable net fiscal impact** for all government levels combined than either first or third-plus generation adults."

This is true even in cross-sectional analysis. Over 75-year projections, second generation contributions are even larger.

**Camarota's approach:** Counts second-generation children's education costs against their immigrant parents, but doesn't project their future tax contributions.

### B. Education Matters Far More Than Immigration Status

The NAS found fiscal impact varies **hugely** by education:

| Education Level | Fiscal Impact Direction |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Less than high school | Negative (all groups) |
| High school | Roughly neutral to slightly positive |
| Some college | Positive |
| Bachelor's degree+ | Strongly positive |

**Key finding:** A native-born high school dropout has a similar fiscal profile to an immigrant high school dropout. The issue is **education level**, not immigrant status per se.

**What this means for illegal immigration:** Since ~69% of adult illegal immigrants have no education beyond high school, the negative fiscal impact is **largely a function of education level**, not of being an immigrant or being here illegally. Native-born people with similar education have similar fiscal profiles.

### C. Immigrants Pay Into Programs They Can't Access

The NAS report found unauthorized immigrants (and many legal non-citizens) are a **"clear net benefit" to Social Security and Medicare** because they:
- Pay payroll taxes (via TINs or fake SSNs)
- Cannot collect benefits

Camarota **acknowledges this** and uses it to argue **against** legalization (saying it would turn the benefit into a cost). But this means his current fiscal impact calculation should show a **positive** contribution to these programs.

### D. Long-Run Economic Growth Effects

The NAS report concluded: "**Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.**"

This includes:
- Innovation spillovers
- Entrepreneurship rates
- Productivity increases for complementary native workers
- Demographic support for aging workforce

**Camarota's approach:** Explicitly dismisses GDP contributions as "irrelevant to fiscal impact," focusing only on tax-minus-spending accounting. The NAS disagrees—it treats economic growth as central to long-run fiscal health.

---

## 6. What Camarota Adds or "Enhances"

To be fair to Camarota, he does add some things the NAS report didn't do:

### A. Specific Focus on Illegal Immigration

The NAS report **intentionally didn't isolate** illegal immigrants due to data limitations. Camarota attempts to do this by:
- Using estimates of the unauthorized population size
- Estimating tax compliance rates (though his 55% figure appears low compared to ITEP)
- Adjusting for program ineligibility

**Value:** This fills a gap in the NAS work
**Problem:** It requires many assumptions that may not be accurate

### B. More Recent Border Data

Camarota includes 2021-2024 border encounter data, which the NAS report couldn't cover. This is legitimately new information.

### C. Household-Level Welfare Use

The NAS report mostly used individual-level analysis. Camarota's household-level welfare statistics (59% of households) do capture a real phenomenon—though as your reviews note, it's largely driven by **U.S. citizen children** being eligible for programs.

## 7. Summary of Key Distortions

### What Camarota Does That Violates NAS Methodology

1. **Averages across scenarios** the NAS said shouldn't be averaged
2. **Focuses on short-term snapshots** the NAS said were incomplete
3. **Ignores multi-generational analysis** the NAS emphasized as critical
4. **Uses outdated data** (2013) to make 2024 claims
5. **Maximizes costs** by using household allocation plus averaging across scenarios
6. **Minimizes tax contributions** by using conservative compliance assumptions

### What the NAS Report Actually Concludes

When read in full, the NAS report's findings are **much more nuanced** than Camarota's testimony suggests:

✓ First-generation immigrants have negative fiscal impacts in short-term, especially at state/local level
✓ BUT second generation are strong fiscal contributors
✓ AND over 75-year timeframe, most immigrant+descendant combinations are fiscally positive or neutral
✓ AND scenario choice (especially public goods allocation) completely determines the results
✓ AND economic growth effects are substantial and positive
✓ AND age structure at time of measurement drives results more than immigrant status per se

**The bottom line:** The NAS report is a sophisticated, carefully hedged analysis that explicitly warns against simplistic interpretations. Camarota's use of it cherry-picks the most negative short-term, first-generation-only findings while ignoring the broader context and methodological warnings.
