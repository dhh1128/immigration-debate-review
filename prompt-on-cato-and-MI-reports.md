I previously asked several AIs to evaluate some testimony delivered to US Congress by Camarota in 2024. It concerns the fiscal impacts of illegal immigration. I am attaching some reports that they generated. I then asked the AIs to dig into the NAS report that Camarota cites in important ways. 

I have become aware that the Cato Institute published a report in 2023 that updates the NAS report: https://www.cato.org/white-paper/fiscal-impact-immigration-united-states

Further, the Manhattan Institute published a report in 2025 that covers similar topics, not attempting to update NAS: https://manhattan.institute/article/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-2025-update

The Cato Institute report existed when Camarota prepared his testimony, but he doesn't cite it -- presumably because it reaches opposite conclusions from him. I believe the Manhattan Institute report also asserts different conclusions from Camarota's.

I'd like you to apply the same kind of filter to the Cato report and the Manhattan Institute report that I asked you and other AIs to apply to Camarota's testimony: as an honest skeptic (neither attempting to undermine nor credulously believing), look at places where the newer reports use logical fallacies or unwarranted assumptions to support a narrative. Evaluate the quality of their data and their conclusions. Also, please tell me what else I should know about the more recent reports that would help me understand their relevance, their limitations, and whether they say important things that Camarota ignores, distorts, or (alternatively) improves upon.
