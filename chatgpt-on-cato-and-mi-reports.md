Below is a skeptical-method review of (1) Cato’s 2023 “The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States” and (2) Manhattan Institute’s 2025 “The Fiscal Impact of Immigration (2025 Update),” with explicit attention to (a) methodology choices that can drive narratives, (b) data quality, (c) inferential leaps, and (d) what each contributes (or obscures) relative to Camarota’s 2024 use of NAS.

## 1) Framing: these reports are not answering identical questions

**Cato (2023)** is explicitly an **NAS-derivative generational accounting** exercise, presenting (i) historical estimates (1994–2018) and (ii) projected net fiscal impacts of an additional immigrant and descendants, with NPVs and long horizons; it compares an “Updated Model” (closer to NAS) to a “Cato Model” with specific methodological changes. ([Cato Institute][1])

**Manhattan Institute (2025)** is explicitly a **CBO-window-aligned** federal budget scoring exercise (10 and 30 years), in **nominal dollars**, with no inflation adjustment for future years and no discounting for time value of money, designed for legislative scoring rather than “true lifetime” accounting. ([Manhattan Institute][2])

**Implication for your comparison task:** if you try to treat all three (NAS/Cato/MI) as interchangeable “the fiscal impact number,” you will be misled. The time horizon, discounting, and which level(s) of government are counted can flip signs and magnitudes.

## 2) Cato (2023): where the “honest skeptic” should focus

### A. Load-bearing methodological choices (potential narrative levers)

1. **Capital deepening / “downward bias” correction**
   Cato’s “most substantial changes” include “correcting for a downward bias” in immigrants’ future fiscal contributions identified by Michael Clemens (2021), by incorporating an economic mechanism for additional capital investment and associated taxes. ([Cato Institute][1])
   **Skeptical note:** this is a legitimate *candidate* correction, but it is also a classic “big swing” assumption: results become sensitive to (i) how much immigration induces capital formation vs. dilutes capital per worker, (ii) incidence and timing of the resulting tax receipts, and (iii) whether the assumed policy baseline for capital taxation remains stable over decades. If those channels are overstated, Cato’s net positives will be overstated.

2. **Reallocation of U.S.-born dependents’ fiscal impact to the second generation**
   Cato reallocates the fiscal impact of U.S.-born dependents of immigrants to the second generation. ([Cato Institute][1])
   **Skeptical note:** conceptually defensible (it reduces “blaming” first-gen parents for benefits received by U.S.-born kids), but it changes what a reader may think they’re seeing. If a public debate question is “how much does immigration increase K–12 costs now,” this reallocation can make first-gen look better while leaving the state/local budget reality unchanged. Cato itself stresses state/local governments can be less positive or negative while federal is more positive. ([Cato Institute][1])

3. **Predicting future education for those too young to have completed schooling**
   Cato uses predictive regression to assign future education levels to young people. ([Cato Institute][1])
   **Skeptical note:** this is necessary for long-run modeling, but it is also a high-variance component. Small shifts in projected educational attainment propagate through lifetime earnings → taxes → means-tested benefits. This is a key place for model risk and overconfidence.

4. **Treatment of public goods**
   Cato notes results depend on how public goods costs are allocated. ([Cato Institute][1])
   **Skeptical note:** public goods allocation is *the* perennial lever in fiscal-impact debates. If public goods are treated as largely fixed, marginal immigrants look cheaper; if treated as per-capita-variable, they look costlier. Cato does not “solve” this; it explores scenarios—so any single-number takeaway should be treated as advocacy, not the report’s full state of knowledge.

5. **Discounting and horizon choices (NPV framing)**
   Cato describes NAS-style generational accounting over long horizons with discounting (3%). ([Cato Institute][1])

* **Equivocation on the unit of analysis**: “immigrants” (as a stock today), “an additional immigrant” (marginal entrant), “immigrant household,” and “immigrant + descendants” are different objects. Cato toggles across them; the reader must not.

### D. What Cato says that is directly relevant to Camarota

1. **Federal vs. state/local split is central**
   Cato explicitly finds state/local can be less positive or negative while federal tends to be more positive. ([Cato Institute][1])
   That matters because K–12 education and some safety-net services are state/local-heavy—the very channels often emphasized in restrictionist narratives.

2. **Education and age-at-arrival dominate**
   Cato’s results emphasize age and education as key drivers (consistent with NAS framing). ([Cato Institute][1])
   This is relevant to evaluating whether Camarota’s approach “maps” illegal immigration composition correctly (education distribution, age profile, household structure, etc.).

---

## 3) Manhattan Institute (2025): where the “honest skeptic” should focus

### A. Load-bearing methodological choices (potential narrative levers)

1. **10- and 30-year window, nominal dollars, no discounting**
   MI explicitly aligns to CBO-style windows and uses nominal dollars with no discounting. ([Manhattan Institute][2])
   **Skeptical note:** this is useful for legislative scoring, but it is *not* a welfare- or lifetime-accounting measure. MI itself acknowledges the drawback: short windows can undercount young immigrants’ later peak tax years and exclude older immigrants’ retirement costs (depending on age at arrival). ([Manhattan Institute][3])
   This is not “wrong,” but it means headline comparisons to NAS-style NPV are apples-to-oranges unless carefully translated.

2. **Including descendants within a 30-year window**
   MI includes children and grandchildren fiscal effects while still operating in a 30-year budget window. ([Manhattan Institute][3])
   **Skeptical note:** within 30 years, descendants are disproportionately observed as children (costs now, taxes later). MI explicitly notes this makes measured impact more negative within the window. ([Manhattan Institute][3])
   This is a major “windowing artifact” that can support a restrictive narrative even if lifetime effects are less negative.

3. **Public goods handling**
   MI states it “soften[s]” public-goods assumptions by excluding defense and “pure public goods” and phasing in “direct” public goods over 10 years. ([Manhattan Institute][3])
   **Skeptical note:** this is an improvement relative to crude per-capita assignment, but it remains a judgment call. Small differences in what counts as “direct,” the phase-in rate, and whether marginal population truly scales those categories can materially change results.

4. **Assumptions about future law/tax policy**
   MI’s report text indicates it assumes extension of present tax rates into the future and references a 2025 law; whether or not one accepts that characterization, the general modeling point stands: long-window fiscal modeling is fragile to future-policy assumptions. ([Manhattan Institute][2])
   **Skeptical note:** any reader should treat such assumptions as scenario inputs, not facts.

5. **Deriving “average legal” vs “average unlawful” immigrant impacts**
   MI produces a large claimed gap (e.g., average legal reduces deficits; average unlawful costs ~$80k over 30 years). ([Manhattan Institute][3])
   **Skeptical note:** this depends on (i) how “unlawful” composition by age/education is estimated, (ii) tax compliance assumptions, and (iii) program eligibility assumptions. These are precisely the parameters with high uncertainty.

### B. Data quality strengths and weaknesses

**Strengths (relative to older NAS-era baselines):**

* Uses more recent CPS/ACS samples (2023–2024 CPS; 2022–2023 ACS for institutionalization). ([Manhattan Institute][3])
* Attempts more detailed adjustments (life expectancy by education, fertility projections, etc.). ([Manhattan Institute][3])

**Weaknesses / uncertainty drivers:**

* The CPS is not designed to perfectly measure taxes and transfers at the individual level; MI relies on allocations from household tax units to individuals. ([Manhattan Institute][3])
* “Unlawful immigrant” identification is inherently indirect in standard surveys; any decomposition into 35 groups by age/education and then into legal status inherits model risk.

### C. Likely reasoning vulnerabilities (fallacy patterns)

* **“Within-window” moral hazard**: Because descendants are mostly children within 30 years, the framework structurally weights education/health costs now more heavily than future adult taxes. MI does acknowledge this dynamic, but advocacy readers will often treat the within-window deficit effect as “the truth.” ([Manhattan Institute][3])
* **False precision**: multi-parameter demographic/fiscal projection outputs are often communicated as point estimates (e.g., “$80,000”) that are not accompanied by uncertainty intervals in public debate. Treat point estimates as scenario outputs.

### D. What MI says that bears directly on Camarota

MI’s own headline distinction is: **average legal immigrant** is fiscally positive in its federal scoring, while **average unlawful immigrant** is fiscally negative over 30 years. ([Manhattan Institute][3])
That partially overlaps with Camarota’s “illegals are a drain” claim, but the mechanisms differ and so do the measuring sticks.

## 4) Comparing both reports to Camarota’s 2024 use of NAS

Camarota’s January 2024 testimony claims: “Using the National Academies’ estimate of immigrants’ net fiscal impact by education level, we estimate that the lifetime fiscal drain … for each illegal immigrant is about $68,000.” ([CIS.org][4])

### A. What Camarota arguably *misses* by not citing Cato (2023)

1. **A direct attempt to update NAS with post-2016 microdata and explicit model revisions**
   Cato positions itself as (i) an Updated NAS-like model plus (ii) a revised “Cato Model,” and it claims immigrants are generally more fiscally positive than natives in most/every scenario depending on public goods treatment. ([Cato Institute][1])
   If you are evaluating a witness’s completeness, omission of a prominent NAS-update paper available at the time is noteworthy—especially if the witness is leaning on NAS-derived education-by-age tables.

2. **Capital-income / capital-adjustment debate**
   Cato foregrounds a Clemens-identified bias correction via capital investment/tax effects. ([Cato Institute][1])
   Even if one disputes it, it is a material methodological dispute that an “honest broker” testimony would typically disclose.

3. **Emphasis on federal vs state/local asymmetry**
   Cato’s explicit “state/local often less positive or negative; federal almost always positive” framing can materially change how one narrates “burden.” ([Cato Institute][1])
   Restrictionist arguments often cite education/health costs borne locally without equally emphasizing federal revenue effects; Cato pushes readers to keep the split in view.

### B. What Camarota may be *more cautious* about than casual readers of Cato/MI

Even in his testimony, Camarota includes caveats (e.g., acknowledging illegal immigrants work and pay taxes, and that the estimate has “caveats”). ([CIS.org][4])
A fair skeptical stance recognizes that **all three** approaches (CIS/Cato/MI) are scenario-driven, model-heavy exercises—not direct measurements.

### C. Where the disagreement can be “real” rather than rhetorical

Many headline contradictions can be explained by four knobs:

1. **Time horizon & discounting** (NAS/Cato NPV long horizon vs MI 10/30 nominal) ([Cato Institute][1])
2. **Descendants accounting** (who “owns” U.S.-born kids’ costs and when) ([Cato Institute][1])
3. **Public goods allocation** (fixed vs per-capita vs phased-in) ([Cato Institute][1])
4. **Unlawful population composition & compliance** (age, education, work, tax compliance, eligibility)

If you force these onto a single axis (“is immigration a drain, yes/no?”), you will end up accusing someone of distortion when they may simply be answering a different question.

---

## 5) What else you should know to interpret “recency” and “relevance”

1. **“Updated” does not mean “settled.”**
   Both Cato and MI update inputs and assumptions, but fiscal-impact modeling remains structurally uncertain because future policy baselines (tax rates, benefit rules, eligibility, healthcare cost growth) matter as much as today’s microdata.

2. **Recent immigration surges are compositionally unusual.**
   Independent of any think tank, the recent period features a surge in arrivals that analysts often treat separately from “typical” legal immigration flows. For example, CBO-oriented discussions commonly reference an unusually large net immigration increment over 2021–2026. ([IDEAS/RePEc][5])
   This matters because the average fiscal impact is sensitive to the mix of categories (workers, families, asylum seekers, etc.) and the timing of labor market entry.

3. **State/local impacts can look worse even when federal looks better.**
   Cato explicitly flags this asymmetry. ([Cato Institute][1])
   So do many non–think tank summaries of recent-surge dynamics (often: federal revenue gains versus local service strain). ([IDEAS/RePEc][6])

---

## 6) Practical checklist for you (to “audit” either report for fallacies)

When you read a contested passage in Cato or MI, ask:

1. **What is the unit?** (individual vs household; immigrant-only vs immigrant+descendants) ([Manhattan Institute][3])
2. **What horizon?** (10, 30, 75 years; NPV vs nominal) ([Manhattan Institute][2])
3. **Which government layer?** (federal vs state/local vs combined) ([Cato Institute][1])
4. **How are public goods treated?** (excluded, per-capita, phased-in) ([Manhattan Institute][3])
5. **What assumptions are doing most of the work?** (capital adjustment; education prediction; fertility; emigration; compliance; eligibility) ([Cato Institute][1])
6. **Do they report sensitivity or only point estimates?** (if only point estimates, treat as scenario outputs, not facts)

➕—If you want, I can produce a side-by-side “assumption ledger” (Cato vs MI vs Camarota) listing each major modeling choice, what direction it tends to push results, and where each report explicitly acknowledges limitations.
