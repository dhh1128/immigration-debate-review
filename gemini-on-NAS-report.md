# ChatGPT on NAS Report
(prompt [here](prompt-on-NAS-report))

This report analyzes the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) report, "*The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration*," and how Steven Camarota utilizes it in his testimony.

### **Executive Summary**

The NAS report is widely considered the "gold standard" of immigration economics because it refuses to provide a single "bottom line" number. Instead, it offers a range of scenarios dependent on accounting choices.

Camarota’s testimony derives its "$68,000 cost" figure by **averaging** these scenarios and restricting the timeline to the **first generation**. This creates a "cost-only" snapshot that is mathematically accurate based on his selected parameters but conceptually ignores the primary economic benefit identified by the NAS: the long-term fiscal surplus of the second generation (the children of immigrants). Furthermore, the NAS data (centered on 2012) predates the current border crisis, meaning the demographic profiles and fiscal baselines are significantly outdated.

### **1. The Data Age Problem: Is the NAS Report Obsolete?**

**Data Vintage:**
You are correct. The NAS report was published in roughly 2017, but the core fiscal estimates were based on data from the **2011–2014 Current Population Survey (CPS)**. The fiscal baseline year used for projections was **2012**.

**Why this matters (2012 vs. 2026):**
The economic reality has shifted in three ways that make the 2012 data potentially misleading for today’s debate:

* **The "Surge" Demographics:** The 2012 undocumented population was largely stable, consisting of long-term residents (often single male workers from Mexico). The post-2021 surge includes far more **families and asylum seekers** who have lower initial labor force participation (due to work permit delays) and higher immediate service needs (shelter/processing).
* **The Debt Burden:** In 2012, U.S. national debt held by the public was roughly **70% of GDP**. Today it is nearly **100%**. This matters because one of the NAS accounting methods assigns a share of "interest on the national debt" to every person in the U.S. As the debt grows, the "cost" assigned to every immigrant rises mechanically, even if the immigrant themselves consumes no additional government services.
* **Labor Market Tightness:** 2012 was a period of recovery from the Great Recession. Today's labor market is tighter, potentially resulting in higher wages (and tax contributions) for low-skilled workers than the 2012 models predicted.

**Verdict:** The NAS report is a high-quality *model*, but its *inputs* are obsolete for describing the specific population currently entering the U.S.

### **2. The "Averaging" Controversy**

Camarota reaches his conclusion by averaging the NAS's 8 different fiscal scenarios. This is a critical methodological choice that significantly impacts the result.

**The 8 Scenarios (The "Public Goods" Problem):**
The NAS could not agree on how to account for "Public Goods"—things like national defense, interest on the debt, and foreign aid.

* **Scenario A (Marginal Cost):** Assumes an immigrant does **not** increase the cost of the military or the national debt. (If you add one immigrant, the Army doesn't buy another tank). *Result: Immigrants look much cheaper.*
* **Scenario B (Average Cost):** Assumes every immigrant should "pay their share" of the military and debt. (Total Defense Budget ÷ Total Population). *Result: Immigrants look much more expensive.*

**Did NAS warn against averaging?**
The NAS report explicitly presents these scenarios side-by-side to illustrate **sensitivity**, not to suggest they should be averaged. By averaging them, Camarota essentially argues, "The truth is somewhere in the middle."

* **Critique:** Many economists argue the **Marginal Cost** model is the only accurate way to measure the impact of *new* immigrants (adding a busboy doesn't require building a new aircraft carrier). By averaging in the "Average Cost" scenarios, Camarota inflates the fiscal burden by assigning fixed costs (like the nuclear arsenal) to poor immigrants.

### **3. The Generational Accounting: The "Investment" vs. The "Cost"**

This is the single most important discrepancy between the NAS findings and Camarota’s testimony.

**What NAS Found:**
The NAS report analyzes immigration as a dynamic timeline:

1. **1st Generation (The Immigrants):** Generally a **fiscal cost** (they educate their kids but often earn low wages).
2. **2nd Generation (The Children):** The **strongest fiscal contributors** in the entire U.S. population (stronger than the children of native-born citizens). They typically have high education, high wages, and high tax compliance, effectively "paying back" the cost of their own education.
3. **3rd Generation:** Regresses to the mean (behaves like average Americans).

**What Camarota Did:**
Camarota’s testimony focuses on the **Lifetime Net Present Value (NPV)** of the **original illegal immigrant only**.

* **The Twist:** He counts the education of the U.S.-born child as a **cost** assigned to the parent.
* **The Omission:** He generally excludes the future tax contributions of that U.S.-born child from the ledger.
* **The Result:** He captures the "investment phase" (spending tax dollars to educate the child) but ignores the "payoff phase" (the child growing up to become a net taxpayer).

**Verdict:** If you view the U.S.-born child as a separate entity (a U.S. citizen), Camarota is inflating the immigrant's cost by assigning the child's school bill to them. If you view the child as a "consequence of immigration," he is distorting the picture by counting the child's *costs* but ignoring the child's *revenue*.

### **4. Summary of NAS Relevance & Distortions**

| Feature | NAS Report (2017) Finding | Camarota's Use / Adjustment | Impact on Truth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Education Profile** | Low-skill immigrants are net costs; High-skill are net gains. | Applies "Low-skill" profile to illegal immigrants. | **Fair.** This is a reasonable demographic assumption supported by data. |
| **Public Goods** | Presents range: Immigrants cost $0 extra for defense OR they cost ~$3,000/yr (share of total). | Averages these scenarios. | **Debatable.** Inflates costs compared to "marginal" economic theory. |
| **Generational Impact** | 1st Gen = Cost.<br>

<br>2nd Gen = Huge Surplus. | Focuses on 1st Gen costs; assigns 2nd Gen *education cost* to parent but not *future tax revenue*. | **Significant Distortion.** Paints an incomplete picture of the long-term ROI. |
| **Federal vs. State** | Immigrants are net **positive** for Federal (payroll taxes) but **negative** for State/Local (schools). | Averages them to show a total "net drain." | **Technically True**, but masks that the Federal govt makes money while States lose money. |
| **Legal Status** | Did **not** distinguish between legal/illegal (data limitations). | Applies his own "downward adjustment" to account for illegal status (less welfare access). | **Speculative.** His adjustment is an internal CIS estimate, not peer-reviewed NAS data. |

### **Conclusion for Your Evaluation**

Camarota is not "lying" about the NAS numbers, but he is performing a specific **accounting operation**:

1. He takes a dataset from 2012 (which may undercount current asylum costs).
2. He selects the "Average Cost" scenarios (which bill immigrants for the military).
3. He assigns the costs of children to the parents but not the benefits.

This produces a "Net Fiscal Drain" conclusion that is true *if* you believe immigrants should pay for the standing military and *if* you believe their children's future taxes shouldn't count toward the parent's ledger. The NAS report itself suggests that if you look at the **long-run dynamic picture** (including the 2nd generation), the fiscal impact is far more neutral or positive.
