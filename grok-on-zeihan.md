### Peter Zeihan's Views on Immigration in *The Accidental Superpower*

In his 2014 book *The Accidental Superpower*, geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan argues that the United States holds a unique advantage over other developed countries because of three main factors: geography, energy independence from shale oil, and demographics. Immigration plays a key role in the demographics part, helping the U.S. avoid the severe "demographic implosion" that threatens many other nations.

Most developed countries face a serious population problem. After World War II, birth rates dropped sharply as people had fewer children. This created a large group of older workers (like Baby Boomers) who are now retiring. Fewer young people are entering the workforce to replace them and pay for pensions, healthcare, and other costs. Countries like Japan, Germany, Russia, and China will have far more retirees than workers in the coming decades. This shrinking workforce means slower economic growth, higher taxes on the young, and possible financial collapse for social systems.

The United States is different. Zeihan explains that America has two big advantages keeping its population younger and growing: higher birth rates from cultural factors (like affordable single-family homes that encourage bigger families) and steady immigration. Immigrants tend to be younger and have more children than native-born Americans. This flow of new people fills jobs, pays taxes, and supports the economy as older generations retire.

Zeihan sees immigration as a huge positive for America's future power. While other countries shrink and struggle, the U.S. will have a larger pool of workers and consumers. This "demographically vibrant society" helps America maintain strong economic growth, innovation, and military strength. By around 2030, Zeihan predicts, the U.S. will stand out as one of the few major economies still expanding, partly because immigration offsets the aging trend that hits everyone else hard.

Zeihan does not focus much on the short-term costs of immigration, such as strains on schools, hospitals, or welfare programs. Instead, he looks at the long-term big picture: more people mean more workers, more ideas, and a bigger market. He contrasts this with Europe, where some countries have taken in immigrants but often struggle with integration. In places with strict or repressive policies, immigrants may form isolated communities (enclaves) where they do not fully mix into society. This can lead to mistrust of police, higher crime in those areas, and social tensions. Zeihan suggests that America's history as a "settler society"—built by waves of immigrants who assimilated over time—makes it better at absorbing newcomers without creating permanent divided groups.

America's success with immigration comes from its open culture and opportunities that draw people in and encourage them to become part of the nation. Zeihan warns that if the U.S. ever adopted highly restrictive policies, it could lose this edge and face the same demographic decline as others.

On the economic side, Zeihan ties immigration to overall strength but does not dive into detailed fiscal calculations, like whether individual immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their lifetimes. Claims that the average immigrant creates a net cost (such as a negative net present value of $68,000) come from studies focused on education levels and welfare use. Zeihan counters this view indirectly by emphasizing long-term benefits: immigrants and their children contribute to growth, fill labor gaps, and help fund retiring Baby Boomers. He argues that without immigration, America's workforce would shrink faster, leading to stagnation like in Japan or Europe.

Zeihan uses demographic data to support his points, including population pyramids (charts showing age groups) for many countries. These visuals show "inverted pyramids" in aging nations—with few young people at the bottom—and a more balanced shape for the U.S., thanks partly to immigration. He projects that by the 2030s, most developed countries will lose population and economic vitality, while America grows.

He does not cite academic sources or footnotes extensively; the book presents data and trends as straightforward facts from public demographic statistics (like United Nations or national census figures). Zeihan quantifies the crisis broadly—for example, noting that many countries will see their working-age populations drop by 20-50% in coming decades—but avoids precise dollar figures for immigration's net impact.

In later chapters, Zeihan links demographics to global disorder. As countries age and weaken, they may become aggressive (like Russia or Turkey) or collapse internally. Immigration could trigger more migration waves and even terrorism if failing states push people out. But for the U.S., welcoming skilled and young immigrants will attract talent and capital fleeing troubled places, further boosting American dominance.

Overall, Zeihan's message on immigration is optimistic for America: it is not just helpful but essential for avoiding the demographic trap that dooms rivals. Repressive approaches elsewhere create problems like isolated enclaves where drugs and violence can grow due to lack of trust in authorities. America's more open system prevents this and turns immigration into a superpower strength. This contrasts sharply with arguments highlighting net fiscal drains, as Zeihan prioritizes macroeconomic and geopolitical gains over per-person cost accounting.
