# Gemini on Cato and MI Reports
(prompt [here](prompt-on-cato-and-mi-reports))

Here is a skeptical analysis of the Cato Institute (2023) and Manhattan Institute (2024/2025) reports, applying the same rigorous "honest skeptic" filter used on Camarota's testimony.

### Overview

While Camarota’s testimony emphasizes the *costs* of illegal immigration (using household-level analysis and average cost accounting), the Cato and Manhattan Institute (MI) reports generally emphasize *benefits* or *nuance* (using individual-level analysis and marginal cost accounting).

However, just as Camarota made methodological choices to maximize costs, these reports make choices that can maximize benefits. An honest skeptic must scrutinize these "dials" just as closely.

## Part 1: Analysis of the Cato Institute Report (2023)

**Source:** "The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States" (Nowrasteh et al.)

### 1. The "Individual vs. Household" Unit of Analysis

**Status: METHODOLOGICAL CHOICE (The Anti-Camarota)**
Cato explicitly rejects the household-level analysis used by Camarota in favor of an **individual** unit of analysis.

* **The Choice:** They count the immigrant’s tax contributions and benefit usage *individually*. If a low-income immigrant has a U.S.-born child, the cost of that child’s education and Medicaid is assigned to the *child* (a U.S. citizen), not the immigrant parent.
* **The Skeptic's View:** This mathematically isolates the immigrant from the costs they "cause." While legally accurate (the child is a citizen), fiscally, that child—and their associated costs—would not exist in the U.S. without the immigrant parent. By shifting these costs to the "native-born" ledger (as the child is native-born), Cato improves the immigrant fiscal balance sheet while worsening the native-born one.
* **Comparison:** Camarota groups the U.S.-born child with the immigrant parent (maximizing immigrant cost); Cato separates them (minimizing immigrant cost). *Neither is "wrong," but both are framing choices that predetermine the result.*

### 2. The "Pure Public Goods" Assumption

**Status: CRITICAL ASSUMPTION**
Fiscal impact studies must decide how to charge immigrants for "public goods" (defense, interest on debt, foreign aid).

* **The Choice:** Cato emphasizes "Scenario 5" from the NAS framework—the "marginal cost" approach. This assumes that adding one immigrant does not increase the cost of National Defense or interest on the debt by a single penny. Therefore, immigrants are charged $0 for these massive budget items.
* **The Skeptic's View:** While logical for *one* immigrant (marginal utility), it becomes questionable for *millions* of immigrants. If the population grows by 15-20%, eventually defense and infrastructure spending scale up. By charging immigrants $0 for these fixed costs, Cato makes their fiscal balance look significantly more positive than if they were assigned an average share of national overhead.

### 3. The "Uncalculated" Undocumented Claim

**Status: UNVERIFIED ASSERTION**
Cato’s main model analyzes *all* immigrants. They acknowledge they do not run a specific model for undocumented immigrants due to data limitations.

* **The Claim:** Despite not running the numbers, the report asserts: "Because undocumented immigrants have reduced eligibility for many benefits programs, their fiscal impact is almost certainly more positive than that of other groups."
* **The Skeptic's View:** This is a logical inference, not a data finding. It ignores that while benefit eligibility is lower, tax compliance (especially income tax) is also often lower for off-the-books workers. Asserting a conclusion without running the specific model falls short of the rigorous data standards applied elsewhere in their report.

### 4. Second-Generation Optimism

**Status: VALID BUT LONG-TERM**
Cato (correctly) cites the NAS finding that the second generation (children of immigrants) are strong fiscal contributors.

* **The Skeptic's View:** This is true, but it introduces a massive time lag. The "profit" from the second generation doesn't materialize for 20-30 years. Using the future taxes of an immigrant’s unborn grandchildren to offset the current costs of the immigrant is a valid *long-term* economic argument, but it doesn't help a state or local government balance its budget *today*.

## Part 2: Analysis of the Manhattan Institute Reports (2024 & 2025 Update)

**Source:** "The Lifetime Fiscal Impact of Immigrants" (Di Martino)

### 1. The "Average" Trap

**Status: STATISTICALLY TRUE BUT POTENTIALLY MISLEADING**
MI headlines that the "average" new immigrant has a lifetime positive fiscal impact.

* **The Nuance:** The report’s own data shows massive variance. A young, educated immigrant is a huge net plus (+$1M+). An elderly or uneducated immigrant is a huge net cost (-$200k+).
* **The Skeptic's View:** Averaging these creates a "positive" number that depends entirely on the *mix*. If the current border surge consists disproportionately of low-education migrants (as Camarota argues), the "average" from the MI report might not apply to the *current* cohort. MI acknowledges this deep in the report, noting that "unlawful immigrants" specifically are a net fiscal cost, but the top-line branding often focuses on the "average immigrant" surplus.

### 2. Unlawful Immigrants = Net Cost (Agreement with Camarota)

**Status: VERIFIED CONVERGENCE**
Contrary to Cato's optimism, the Manhattan Institute *does* model unlawful immigrants specifically and finds them to be a net fiscal drain.

* **The Finding:** MI estimates the "border crisis" (recent unlawful arrivals) will cost roughly **$1 trillion** over their lifetimes.
* **The Skeptic's View:** This is a crucial validation of Camarota’s directional finding, though the magnitude differs. It highlights that Cato’s assumption (that undocumented status = positive fiscal impact due to low benefits) may be incorrect because low wages/taxes outweigh the benefit savings.

### 3. The "Nominal Dollars" Shift (2025 Update)

**Status: METHODOLOGICAL RED FLAG**
In their 2025 update, MI shifts to estimating impacts over a 30-year congressional budget window using **nominal** (non-inflation-adjusted) dollars.

* **The Choice:** They project future tax revenue in 2054 dollars (inflated) but compare it to debt/costs without standard discounting methods used in academic economics (Net Present Value).
* **The Skeptic's View:** This is highly unusual for rigorous economic analysis. Measuring future cash flows in nominal dollars inflates the appearance of future tax revenues. A dollar earned in 2054 is worth much less than a dollar spent today. This methodological choice likely inflates the "positive" fiscal impact numbers significantly compared to the standard NPV approach used in their 2024 report and by the NAS.

### 4. The "Native-Born" Tu Quoque

**Status: CONTEXTUALLY VITAL**
Both MI and Cato emphasize that *native-born* Americans without college degrees are also massive fiscal drains (-$200k to -$300k lifetime).

* **The Argument:** They argue it is unfair to single out immigrants for being a fiscal burden when low-skilled natives are the same.
* **The Skeptic's View:** This is a valid context but a "whataboutism" regarding policy. A government cannot deport or refuse entry to native-born citizens; it *can* set criteria for new entrants. The fact that natives are expensive doesn't economically justify importing more expensive residents, though it does strip the "moral failing" stigma from the discussion.

## Summary Comparison

| Feature | **Camarota (CIS)** | **Cato (Nowrasteh)** | **Manhattan Inst. (Di Martino)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Goal** | Highlight Costs | Highlight Benefits | Highlight Selection/Merit |
| **Unit of Analysis** | **Household** (Includes US-born kids) | **Individual** (Excludes US-born kids) | **Individual** (Excludes US-born kids) |
| **Public Goods** | **Average Cost** (High cost to immigrants) | **Marginal Cost** (Zero/Low cost to immigrants) | **Mixed/Marginal** |
| **Illegal Immigrants** | **Net Drain** ($68k lifetime) | **Likely Positive** (Asserted, not modeled) | **Net Drain** (But less than low-skill natives) |
| **Second Generation** | Ignored/Omitted | Central to long-term benefit | Included in long-term models |
| **Key "Dial" Used** | Attributing citizen-child costs to immigrant parents. | Assuming immigrants cost $0 in defense/debt interest. | Averaging high-skill surpluses to mask low-skill deficits. |

### Bottom Line for the Skeptic

* **Read Cato** to understand the "Pure Economic Potential" view: If you assume zero fixed costs and ignore the costs of U.S.-born children, immigrants look great.
* **Read Camarota** to understand the "Taxpayer Burden" view: If you count the U.S.-born children and charge immigrants for their share of national defense, low-skill immigrants look expensive.
* **Read Manhattan Institute** for the "Selectionist" view: They validate that *unlawful/low-skill* immigration is a fiscal drain (agreeing with Camarota) but argue that *high-skill* immigration is such a massive surplus that the focus should be on swapping the former for the latter.

**Crucial Takeaway:** The difference between a "$68,000 cost" (Camarota) and a "Net Benefit" (Cato) is not usually a difference in data—it is almost entirely a difference in **whether you count the U.S.-born child as a cost** and **whether you charge the immigrant for the U.S. military.**
