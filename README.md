Here I'm publishing an analysis of the cost and benefits of immigration in the United States.

I do not claim that my analysis is complete, and I do not claim to be a deep expert. I'm just an ordinary guy who has a day job and lots of other things to think about. However, I have tried to be fair-minded and thoughtful, and to get high-quality evidence. I'm also emphatically unaffiliated with any political party. Given the dysfunctional debates on this topic that I see everywhere, I think that at least makes my analysis unusual. I hope it also might be useful.

Before you read my conclusions, you might want to know about [the process I followed](process.md). That doc discusses the primary sources I consulted. I also did a lot of work with AI to crunch data; at the bottom of this doc, I give [links to what I said to the AIs and what they gave me back](#ai-interactions). Note that I also sprinkle some other references here and there as [endnotes](#endnotes). These are just to support more isolated facts that I looked up. The major source for everything that's not footnoted is the analysis discussed in the [process doc](process).

## My conclusions

The effects of legal and illegal immigration on our society are complex. They manifest with different degrees of positivity and negativity in many places, and across many dimensions and time horizons: fiscal impacts at the local, state, and national level; pressures on law enforcement; demographic shifts in population age distributions, education, and workforce composition; international relations; cultural currents at regional and national levels. Anybody who says this issue can be understood simply is either foolish or selling something.

One thing that my research sensitized me to is that a lot of rhetoric on this topic plays free and loose with how people are categorized. Are people who have a pending request for asylum or a visa that they properly asked to renew but are caught in red tape "illegal"? Depends on who you ask, and what narrative they want to construct &mdash; they're counted one way to inflate some numbers, and another way to depress others.

### Economic impact
The MAGA narrative that immigration of all kinds is a major *financial* disaster for the country is a distortion. Parts of it are substantially false; other parts needs nuance. Insisting otherwise is uninformed or disingenuous. Have a look at [the AI analyses](#ai-interactions) of Camarota, the NAS report, the Cato report, and the MI report, for details.

- Highly educated immigrants—especially in specialty-occupation programs like H-1B—tend to be net fiscal contributors over the long run, and the evidence consistently finds education level is a major predictor of positive fiscal impact. High-skilled immigration is also associated with higher rates of innovation (including patenting) and often shows limited displacement of comparable native workers. While effects vary by occupation and local labor markets, policies that attract and retain high-skill workers are generally aligned with U.S. economic growth and public-finance interests. [1, 2, 3]
- Poorly educated immigrants do consume more than they produce. This is particularly true at the local and state level. However, the imbalance is not as bleak as some immigration critics claim.
- Most of the unbalanced consumption is associated with either older immigrants whose productive years are waning, or with children. Immigrants in prime working ages (20s, 30s, etc) are not a strong locus of this problem.
- Many who consume assistance are US citizen children of immigrants &mdash; MAGA supporters like the term "anchor babies". While it's conceivable that the legal treatment of future babies born in the US could change, this wouldn't change the economic consequences of children who are already US citizens; many arguments for the benefits of less immigration hand wave past this.
- Despite the pejorative term "anchor babies", expert consensus across the ideological spectrum makes it clear that eventually, the children of immigrants more than pay us back for *their own* education and other expenses in childhood. Whether they also pay us back for the overuse of assistance by their extended families is debatable. Here experts disagree, mostly because they make different assumptions about time horizons and how to impute costs. Critics of immigration want to analyze payback over short time horizons like 10 years, and they want to divide fixed costs like funding the Department of Defense across the entire population. Advocates of immigration want to analyze payback over 75 years and assert that defending our borders costs roughly the same regardless of how many immigrants we have. I question some assumptions of every expert analysis I looked at, but if I had to guess after taking all the reasoning, data, and assumptions into account and squinting a bit, I'd say it's probably a wash. Neither side convinces me of their more extreme positions.
- Costs are felt most intensely in health care and early childhood education; these are more local than federal. Costs at the federal level are more offset by eventual federal wages, taxes, and social security contributions. I feel more sympathy for a mayor or a governor who's complaining about immigration costs, and less sympathy for federal officials.
- I find Zeihan's argument compelling. He asserts that pluralistic western societies are on the road to demographic collapse (pretty inarguable, with most of Europe and large parts of Asia having an average birth rate below 1.0, and 2.1 being required to sustain a population). The consequences may be dire: an inability to care for an aging population because the tax base erodes, military weakness, stagnating economies, etc. Whether you believe the apocalyptic version of this future, or only a problematic one, it is clear that immigration is a hedge. Importing human resources is already benefitting the United States in ways that will pay dividends in coming decades, and that are not going to be duplicated by any amount of tariffs or domestic labor stimulation initiatives. I think this is probably the single worst form of short-sightedness in MAGA immigration narratives.

### Legal impact
If we switch from a purely financial focus to a legal one, the analysis is different. I didn't find hard data on this, but common sense leads me to believe the assertion that neighborhoods with a collective incentive to avoid law enforcement create dangerous environments &mdash; effectively, ghettos &mdash; where drugs and human-trafficking have less constraints. To the extent that immigrants cluster in neighborhoods, then, we would expect problems. However, I also believe Zeihan's argument, unanswered by MAGA proponents, that aggressive enforcement efforts make this worse. When ICE is sweeping through a neighborhood breaking up families, chasing people through the park, and interrupting them at work, and when people who are trying to follow the process in approved ways get arrested at green card interviews, concerns about vulnerability harden into enmity and opposition. We teach these people that our law enforcement mechanisms will hurt them, not treat them impartially, and in so doing, we make it more likely that crime will hide. (The [AI analyses of Zeihan](#ai-interactions) are relevant here.)

Immigrants are generally more law-abiding than US citizens, not less, and I do not believe a narrative that ascribes human and drug trafficking directly to immigrants; immigrants are the victims of such activities far more than they are the perpetrators. Ironically, there is even some evidence that this is true of illegal immigrants. [4] However, the latter claim is controversial and must be filtered through the true MAGA comeback that these people are inherently breaking the law just by being here. I don't know how to balance these two points. However, I would say that loyalty to law in general and loyalty to a specific law are different &mdash; as every person who considers themselves moral but who jaywalks or speeds on the freeway must admit. It seems to me that immigration laws are more ethically consequential than the two trivial examples I just gave, but how much more is hard to say. If you believe my conclusions about the fiscal impacts of immigration, you can't argue that they're more consequential on economic grounds...

A voice that I respect pointed out to me on Facebook that whether we agree with laws or not, it's hard to argue for any enforcement strategy that doesn't call for people to conform to the laws as written. What other standard could we possibly adopt? I think this is a true argument, but overly theoretical. In practice, many laws are routinely underenforced, and there are often good socieoeconomic, logistical, political, and humanitarian reasons for such choices. I don't think immigration is a special category where perfect enforcement must be the standard.

Few of the legal arguments about immigration touch on cost, and I think that's a miss in the analysis. How much does it cost to staff ICE to a particular level, to maintain detention centers, etc? And how much are these costs offset by the drastic decrease in border encounters that we're now seeing? I don't know the answer, and I won't speculate; I just think a cost/benefit analysis would be helpful.

Bottom line: I think legal concerns about immigration are fair, but it's easy to exaggerate them, and we'd be better served by focusing partial enforcement efforts on true criminals. This is the avowed policy of our current administration, but numerous anecdotes tell me it's not reality, and that's a shame. [5]

## Cultural impact
I think this is the most subjective dimension of the issue. Immigration, both legal and illegal, changes the ethnic and cultural composition of neighborhoods, school classes, and workplaces. Is that a good thing, a bad thing, or just a *thing*?

I'm a little bit sympathetic to those who want to be surrounded by those who look like them physically or culturally. I was a religious minority for most of my childhood. It wasn't a terrible experience (I'd gladly move back to the parts of the midwest that I know and love), but there were a few moments of awkwardness and isolation, and I remember feeling happy to find more in common with my peers when I moved out west. The desire to fit in can be innocent and reasonable. Further, I believe that it's important to honor the language and culture where one lives by making a good faith effort to assimilate, which is why I invested heavily in learning French when I lived in the Suisse Romande.

However, I think it must be noted that bemoaning the cultural changes that come with immigration is also the height of hypocrisy for most of us. Unless we have pure Native American ancestry, we all derive from immigration backstories. Our ancestors once immigrated (systematically ignoring established tribal law that governed the land), and forced sweeping cultural changes. The stakes and scale of what we're debating now are much smaller, and our abilities to absorb are many orders of magnitude greater...

On the scale of competing values, a desire for homogeneous communities should not rank among our highest priorities. Definitions of community that depend on surface sameness are not only shallow but historically dangerous. Time and again, this way of thinking has justified the abuse of vulnerable minorities—from the civil rights era in the American South, to the persecution of Uyghurs in China, to the Hutu–Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, to ethnic cleansing during the Balkan wars.

Beyond its moral costs, prioritizing outward sameness is also profoundly short-sighted. Is physical appearance, religious affiliation, or partisan identity really the most important form of commonality a society can share? Or is community better defined by deeper commitments: caring for a shared physical space, raising children in safety, fostering innovation, and building thriving businesses? If we take that view, it becomes clear that diversity is not a threat to cohesion but a source of resilience—one that enriches communities rather than impoverishing them.

I do agree, strongly, with the concern that I mostly hear from MAGA folks about immigrants who have strong loyalties to worldviews that are inherently hostile to our own. A fondness for one's native country and one's family who resides there is not a negative characteristic in an immigrant &mdash; but a hatred for western pluralsim and a loyalty to crime, jihad, communism, and similar ideas should be a strict and immediate disqualifier.

## Humanitarian impact
This section, and the next, depart a bit from the evidence that drove me to publish this analysis. I include the topics because they do arise in debates about immigration policy.

Whether we should attempt to bring to pass global good with our tax dollars is an interesting question. I think the answer depends on the timeframe over which we evaluate the question, and what types of intervention we're considering (because some "humanitarian" choices actually offset other expenses that might be less efficient uses of our resources). I'll argue that below, in the section about international relations. But set that aside for a moment and just consider the question of whether immigration does or can have any humanitarian benefits.

There's a dramatic [video](https://www.numbersusa.com/resources/videos/) circulating that uses gumballs to illustrate how immigration into the United States can never meaningfully reduce global poverty. I do not dispute the numerical claims the video cites, and one could reasonably debate lower immigration levels on other grounds. But the video’s presentation feels like a sleight-of-hand that invites the audience to fixate on the wrong problem. 

What matters in most humanitarian immigration policy is *why* people are allowed to enter, not *whether* they are poor. Under current U.S. law, the humanitarian grounds on which most legal immigration status is granted are framed around protection from persecution, violence, or other serious harm — for example, the refugee definition incorporated into U.S. law requires a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Poverty does not make someone eligible for asylum or refugee status. [6] In other words, the video’s portrayal sets up a straw man: it invites us to equate "humanitarian considerations" with poverty relief, then critiques that narrow justification.

Anyway, I think humanitarian considerations are more nuanced than the video allows. Consider:

* The vast majority of the global poor (the gumballs that Beck pours so dramatically) don't actually *want* to immigrate to the US, and nobody is proposing that they be allowed to do so.
* The benefits of having an immigrant become a US citizen with access to education and economic opportunity are not limited to that individual. They get passed on to future generations and to the larger US economy (as argued in the economic section above), but also to family members and strangers in foreign countries. Whatever help *is* accomplished by humanitarian decisions, its scope is far bigger than just the direct immigrant. (To argue otherwise is inconsistent with another argument of immigrant critics, which is that costs are greater than a single individual.)
* The starfish argument still applies. You know the story: a boy is picking up starfish and throwing them back into the ocean. Someone critiques him because he can't possibly do this for all the starfish; he responds that although he can't make a difference for all, his actions certainly make a difference for some. At least some lost boys from Sudan certainly have better lives as refugee immigrants in the US than they would have had in their native country.

## International relations impact
I have not done research about, and I am not qualified to argue the details of, the effectiveness of foreign aid. I know this is a controversial question and that many US taxpayers are incensed that we would spend anything outside the boundaries of our own country, and I get it. I also don't dispute claims that some aid is misspent.

However, I think purist claims about the categorical inappropriateness of foreign aid are short-sighted. If we could avoid getting entangled in a foreign war tomorrow that cost <var>X</var> billion by strategically spending <var>Y</var> million today, would that not be wise? (Yes, that's an important "if", but the arguments are usually made on principle, so I'm asking a questiona bout principle.)

Of course, immigration is not the same as foreign aid, but I suggest that it has certain similar benefits, from the perspective of international relations. Historically, marriage often served to ally rival political powers, softening and realigning loyalties that otherwise would have been starkly opposed. The same thing happens, I think, with immigrants. Which is more likely to have a generous view of American political goals: a grandmother in Mexico whose children and grandchildren live there, and who interacts with them over Zoom as they share their sporting events and school concerts &mdash; or a grandmother in Mexico whose entire family lives next door? Now multiply that answer by millions...

The same phenomenon unfolds at the nation-state level. Nations that have large diasporas among the US immigrant population are susceptible to lobbying and influence by that diaspora. US immigration policy becomes a negotiation point in hard-headed, pragmatic diplomacy.

There is also another dimension to immigration and international relations: the value of foreign public perception. Having lived in Europe, I can personally attest that it is possible for aggressive immigration policies in the US to poison public opinion about us abroad. A pure pragmatist might take a position similar to Trump's, claiming that we don't give a fig for any opinion that's non-American, and that the only thing that matters is that foreigners respect/fear us. I am more nuanced. It is true that an American president should not cater to foreign voters, but it can be short-sighted to project power only by being a bully. No bully gets his way all the time, winning by muscle is often more expensive than winning by other means, and everybody benefits from having allies. I feel like we are underindexing on this consideration in our immigration policies.

## Summary
On the whole, my deep dive on this topic has helped me discover some nuances I wasn't aware of before, and has convinced me that the simplistic stories that show up in memes and political headlines are doing us a disservice. I have not been convinced, after serious study, that immigration &mdash; even illegal immigration &mdash; is terrible for the country. I just don't buy it, even after real time in the best evidence that MAGA advocates can muster. Yes, I'm convinced that it has costs. But it also has some clear economic benefits, and it looks to me like the two offset each other, roughly. Demographically, immigration feels like a huge win. From a legal perspective, it's muddy. We clearly need certain kinds of enforcement. However, I feel we need to cut with a razor, not a bludgeon, and that public perceptions of the fairness and reasonableness of law enforcement matter far more than immigration critics want to allow. Culturally, immigration has mixed effects, but I'd say the preponderance are quite positive, and that the negative effects are just part of being a pluralistic society. From a humanitarian perspective, immigration has a place, though the amount of immigration we permit, and the benefits we attribute, feel debatable.

The [other perspectives](claude-on-other-perspectives) on this issue probably deserve careful exploration, but I'll leave that for another time.

[4] The National Academies’ crime issue brief (from its immigration integration work) summarizes the empirical literature as finding lower crime, arrest, and incarceration rates among immigrants than among the native-born. It also reports a concrete comparison from prior research: foreign-born men ages 18–39 had incarceration rates about one-fourth those of U.S.-born men. PNAS
is a widely cited peer-reviewed paper using Texas Department of Public Safety arrest records (2012–2018). It finds undocumented immigrants have substantially lower felony arrest rates than both legal immigrants and native-born citizens. In headline comparisons, the authors report that U.S.-born citizens are >2× as likely to be arrested for violent felonies, 2.5× for drug felonies, and >4× for property felonies; and that overall felony arrest rates are roughly ~1,000 per 100,000 (U.S.-born) vs ~400 per 100,000 (undocumented) in that period. Abramitzky et al. construct a nationally representative series of incarceration rates by nativity over ~150 years and conclude immigrants have had lower incarceration rates than the U.S.-born throughout the period, with the gap widening after 1960. In their summary statistic, immigrants “today are 60% less likely to be incarcerated” than U.S.-born men (and 30% less likely relative to U.S.-born whites). See:<br>
