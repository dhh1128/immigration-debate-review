Notable findings from a skeptical verification pass (15 items)

1. **The “record FY2022 overstay” claim is broadly supported by a DHS primary source, but Camarota’s narrative glosses over definitional nuance.** He asserts FY2022 overstays “hit a record” and cites DHS figures (850k; 3.67%).  DHS’s FY2022 Entry/Exit Overstay Report states a total overstay rate of **3.67%** and **853,955 overstay events**, which supports the numerical core. ([Department of Homeland Security][1]) The important nuance: “overstay events” are not the same thing as “people who became long-term unauthorized residents,” which Camarota partially acknowledges. 

2. **“Nearly 8 million encounters (Jan 2021–Nov 2023)” is directionally plausible, but the testimony does not show the calculation and relies on a dashboard whose definitions changed over time.** He cites CBP’s “Nationwide Encounters” page.  That page is a legitimate primary source for the *encounter* concept and CBP’s published counts. ([Customs and Border Protection][2]) But the testimony does not document the summation logic (time window, inclusion of OFO/USBP, treatment of Title 42 vs Title 8), so the reader cannot independently reproduce “nearly 8 million” from the testimony alone.

3. **The “got-aways” section mixes primary and non-primary sources; the headline “1.5 million got-aways” rests heavily on non-primary reporting for FY2022–FY2023.** DHS’s Office of Homeland Security Statistics report provides the *definition* and historical “detected got-aways” through FY2021, including the 2021 jump Camarota cites.  ([Office of Health Security Solutions][3]) However, Camarota acknowledges DHS “has not published any newer numbers” and then relies on **Fox News** and an interpretation of a press exchange to extend the series.  As an “honest skeptic” matter: the FY2022/FY2023 components are not verifiable from a public DHS primary publication in his citations, so the 1.5M figure is materially less robust than the FY2021 piece.

4. **The “2.7 million inadmissible aliens released” claim is not supported by a single primary statistical release in the testimony; it is mediated through a CIS estimate.** He attributes the number to “court records and other information” plus a CIS colleague’s reconstruction.  The cited trail (Texas v. Biden disclosures + CBP/ICE web pages + CIS blog synthesis) is not equivalent to a straightforward DHS/CBP statistical series, and the testimony does not provide the underlying extraction tables.  This is a key place where the claim is **not “primary-source clean,”** even if it may ultimately be defensible.

5. **His classification move—treating many released asylum applicants/parolees as “illegal immigrants”—is a major framing choice that is not purely empirical.** He states released individuals with pending asylum/parole are “still illegal immigrants” because not formally admitted and are removable.  Whether one labels such populations “illegal/unauthorized” versus “lawfully present pending adjudication” is partly a legal/administrative categorization question and partly a rhetorical choice; the testimony does not engage alternative official terminology. This framing decision affects later fiscal arguments because it expands the counted group.

6. **The “illegal population grew to 12.8 million by Oct 2023” claim is presented as “preliminary” and depends on modeling choices (including undercount) that are not auditable from the testimony alone.** He explicitly labels the CPS-based estimate preliminary and notes uncertainties (legal inflows data gaps; emigration assumptions; undercount uncertainty).  The transparency about uncertainty is a positive; the downside is that, as written, the reader cannot independently validate the 12.8M figure because the adjustment method and parameter values are not supplied in reproducible detail.

7. **Education-distribution claims are reasonably grounded in well-known secondary compilers (MPI, CMS), but they are still not “primary” measurements of legal status.** He averages MPI and CMS distributions for unauthorized immigrants’ education.  MPI/CMS are reputable, but both necessarily infer unauthorized status from survey microdata and assumptions (since major surveys do not directly ask “are you unauthorized?”). Treat as “best-available modeled estimates,” not direct observation.

8. **The $68k “lifetime net fiscal drain per illegal immigrant” is built on a legitimate primary study (National Academies), but Camarota’s method introduces a non-trivial assumption: averaging eight scenarios that the Academies explicitly do not rank.** He states the National Academies model produces eight scenarios and “does not identify which scenario is most likely,” then he averages them anyway.  This is not necessarily “wrong,” but it is an **assumptional leap**: an unweighted mean implicitly asserts equal plausibility across scenarios. The Academies report does present scenario-based fiscal impacts by education, supporting the existence of the underlying quantities. ([National Academies][4])

9. **His “adjusting … for inflation and legality” step is not fully inspectable in this testimony and embeds directional choices that could swing the estimate.** He says he adjusts the Academies’ all-immigrant results for “inflation and legality.”  The testimony includes a table/adjustment factor narrative only at a high level; the precise mechanics and sensitivity are not presented in a way that allows an external skeptic to replicate. That is a methodological weakness for such a central quantitative headline.

10. **He is candid that NPV framing can understate lifetime fiscal burdens of low-education immigrants relative to undiscounted lifetime sums—this is a methodological “pro” (transparent caveat), not a “con.”** He notes that using net present value discounts future costs and therefore reduces the apparent magnitude of long-run drains for less-educated immigrants.  (endnote discussion) This is a meaningful concession that cuts *against* sensationalism, and it is logically consistent with discounting.

11. **The “59% of illegal-immigrant households use welfare” headline is not purely “government data”; it relies on a probabilistic imputation of unlawful status inside SIPP.** He says the study uses 2022 SIPP (a Census Bureau instrument), but then explains they “assign weighted probabilities” to identify illegal immigrants.  That means the welfare-use rate is **model output**, not a directly tabulated government statistic by legal status. This does not falsify the estimate, but it substantially changes how strong the claim is.

12. **The welfare “program basket” definition is expansive and includes items that many readers do not intuitively classify as ‘welfare,’ which can drive headline rates upward without being fraudulent.** Their basket includes **EITC and school meals** along with Medicaid, SNAP, housing, etc.  A skeptic should treat “59% use welfare” as “59% used *at least one program in this broad basket*,” not necessarily “59% received cash assistance.”

13. **His explanation for high welfare use—citizen children eligibility, state-funded coverage, and school-meal/WIC eligibility—is broadly consistent with primary/authoritative sources, though he sometimes cites advocacy/secondary summaries.** He claims (a) many households have US-born children; (b) some states cover undocumented immigrants with state funds; (c) some states provide state-funded food aid; (d) school meals can be accessed regardless of immigration status.  State-funded health coverage variation is well documented by KFF. ([KFF][5]) State-funded food assistance programs for immigrants ineligible for federal SNAP are documented by NILC’s table (advocacy org, but it compiles state program law/policy). ([NILC][6]) For school meals, USDA/FNS guidance indicates eligibility can be independent of immigration status (at least in key operational guidance). ([Food and Nutrition Service][7])

14. **The public-education cost figure ($68.1B) is arithmetically straightforward but attributionally loaded: it assigns the full schooling cost of ~4M children (mostly U.S. citizens) to “illegal immigration.”** He explicitly says most of the ~4M children are US-born, yet he still frames the fiscal load as a cost “illegal immigration” creates.   The per-pupil spending numbers are available from NCES and do support that the order of magnitude is plausible. ([National Center for Education Statistics][8]) But the key skeptic point is conceptual: this is a causal-attribution judgment (parents’ status → child’s schooling cost) more than a direct fiscal accounting of services consumed by unauthorized adults.

15. **The uninsured-care estimate (~$7B) is explicitly a rough proportional allocation; it uses credible components (MPI unauthorized uninsured estimate; KFF uncompensated care public funds) but requires several strong proportionality assumptions.** He uses MPI’s estimate of uninsured unauthorized immigrants and then applies their share of the uninsured to public uncompensated-care spending.   KFF reports at least **$33.6B** in public funds supporting uncompensated care for the uninsured (in the relevant period). ([KFF][9]) The inferential leap is assuming spending per uninsured person is similar across groups (then partially backing off by noting immigrants use less care on average).  This is cautious, but still materially assumption-dependent.

**Bottom-line assessment:** Camarota’s testimony mixes (i) some solid anchors in primary government or quasi-governmental sources (CBP encounters pages; DHS overstay report; DHS OHSS historical got-away table; National Academies; NCES; KFF uncompensated care) ([Customs and Border Protection][2]) with (ii) several central headline quantities that are **reconstructions or model-based estimates** (2.7M released; FY22–FY23 got-aways; 12.8M unauthorized population; 59% “welfare use” as defined; $68k lifetime NPV), where the testimony does not provide reproducible computation detail.
