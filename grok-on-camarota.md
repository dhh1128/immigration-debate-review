1. The claim of 2.7 million inadmissible aliens released into the U.S. since January 2021 is based on court-disclosed data from Texas v. Biden and DHS websites, as interpreted by CIS's Andrew Arthur (footnote 2 in testimony). This is a primary source (court records and official stats), and the estimate aligns with available data without skew; however, it relies on partial disclosures and may not capture all adjustments, representing a reasonable but preliminary aggregation.

2. The estimate of 1.5 million "got-aways" since January 2021 combines DHS's primary metrics for FY 2021 (391,000) with secondary sources like Fox News for FY 2022 (599,000) and a Mayorkas press conference for FY 2023 (>530,000) (footnotes 3-6). This is robust but mixes primary and secondary; a CBO primary estimate for FY 2023 alone is higher at 860,000, suggesting Camarota's total may understate, though his reasoning accounts for pre-Biden months logically without fallacies.

3. The assertion of a record 850,000 visa overstays in FY 2022, with a 3.67% rate, directly matches DHS's primary FY 2022 Entry/Exit Overstay Report (footnote 7). This is accurate, current at the time, and robust; no better sources ignored, as this is the authoritative federal report.

4. The preliminary estimate of the illegal population growing to 12.8 million by October 2023 (up 2.6 million since January 2021) uses Census Bureau's monthly CPS data, adjusted for undercount (footnote 10). This is primary data, but the net increase assumption involves leaps like unchanged out-migration post-COVID; DHS's primary estimate is lower at 11 million in January 2022, indicating potential overestimation, though Camarota discloses it as preliminary.

5. The education level claim (69% of adult illegal immigrants have no education beyond high school vs. 35% of U.S.-born) averages primary estimates from MPI and CMS (footnote 18). MPI's profile confirms ~68% (42% less than HS + 26% HS), and U.S.-born figures align with Census data; reasoning is sound, no leaps, and sources are robust and current (2019/2015-2019).

6. The lifetime fiscal drain of $68,000 per illegal immigrant uses the National Academies' 2017 primary study (footnote 21), averaging eight scenarios and adjusting for legality/inflation. This is disclosed with caveats (e.g., applies to all immigrants, fiscal deterioration since 2012); reasoning is transparent and sound, but assumes equal applicability to illegals and ignores potential better sources like updated NAS analyses, as the 2017 study is somewhat dated.

7. The 59% welfare use rate for illegal immigrant households (vs. 39% U.S.-born) comes from CIS's analysis of 2022 SIPP data, using probability weighting to identify illegals (footnote 25). Methodology is primary and detailed, but involves assumptions like undercount adjustments; no fallacies, but SIPP's known undercount of illegals (admitted) could skew higher use rates upward.

8. The rough $42 billion in welfare benefits for illegal immigrants is an approximation based on their 4% share of recipients in examined programs, using CRS federal spending data (footnote 32) and KFF state Medicaid figures (footnote 33). Sources are primary and robust; reasoning acknowledges data limitations (e.g., no detailed costs per household), avoiding leaps, but the estimate's roughness is appropriately caveated.

9. Explanations for high welfare use despite restrictions (e.g., U.S.-born children eligibility, state Medicaid/SNAP, work authorization for EITC) cite primary sources like HUD handbooks, KFF, NILC, and federal law (footnotes 26-30). This is solid, without skew; reasoning highlights systemic design aiding low-wage workers, a logical point without fallacies.

10. The $68.1 billion public education cost for 4 million children of illegal immigrants in 2019 updates Pew's primary 2014 estimate (3.925 million) using 2019 ACS, multiplied by NCES's $17,013 per pupil (footnotes 35-36). Sources primary; update reasonable, but pre-surge and excludes extra costs like ESL (conservative, as noted); no ignored better sources.

11. The 5.8 million uninsured illegal immigrants (53% rate) in 2019, accounting for ~1/5 of uninsured, uses MPI's primary estimate (footnote 37) and Census data (footnote 38). Accurate; $7 billion care cost is rough, based on KFF's $33.6 billion uncompensated care (footnote 39), with caveats for lower consumption; sound reasoning, no fallacies.

12. Tax payments by illegal immigrants in 2019 ($5.9B federal income, $16.2B Social Security, $3.8B Medicare) are estimated from CPS data, assuming 55% work "on the books" (footnote 41 from 2004 CIS study). Primary data, but assumption dated; aligns with SSA estimates (footnote 40); reasoning sound, but could use updated on-books rate.

13. The point that illegal immigrants create a net positive for Social Security/Medicare but legalization would reverse this uses CIS analysis (footnote 45). Logical, based on progressive benefits; no leaps, but ignores counterarguments like long-term contributions from legalized workers.

14. The $321 billion GDP addition in 2019, mostly accruing to immigrants themselves, is derived from CPS labor incomes assuming 60% labor share (footnote 46). Reasoning emphasizes per capita vs. aggregate GDP soundly, avoiding conflation fallacy; estimate simplified (admitted), but no better ignored sources like CBO's immigration GDP analyses.

15. New York City's projected $12 billion cost over three years for migrants is cited from a primary NYT article quoting Mayor Adams (footnote 12). Accurate at time, but actual spending was lower (~$1.45B FY2023 per city data); no skew, but uses projection without noting potential variance.

16. Chicago's estimated $361 million 2023 migrant cost is from a primary WTTW article (footnote 14). However, actual spending was $138 million per city data, showing the testimony used a projection that overstated; this is a minor leap, as projections can change, but better to note as estimate.

17. Other city costs (e.g., DC $36.4M FY2023, Denver $180M 2024, Massachusetts $2B over two years) cite primary sources like Washington Post, News9, and state memo (footnotes 15-17). Solid and current; no fallacies, though focuses on high estimates without counterexamples of lower burdens.

18. Overall reasoning that illegal immigrants are a net drain due to education/income, not laziness/fraud, is supported throughout with data; avoids ad hominem, but assumes education levels of recent arrivals match priors (footnote 19), a leap without direct data—though caveated.

19. Sources are generally current (2021-2023 for surge, 2017-2019 for fiscal baselines), but some like NAS 2017 and 2004 on-books assumption are older; Camarota notes fiscal worsening since 2012, mitigating this, and no strong evidence of ignoring better (e.g., 2023 CBO surge impacts align directionally).

20. No major logical fallacies detected; arguments build sequentially without strawmen, but some estimates are "rough" with disclosed assumptions—honest, but requires reader acceptance of CIS's methodologies, which are primary but from an advocacy group.
